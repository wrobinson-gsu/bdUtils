%X The number of IT professionals in the workplace depends in large part on the number of new university technology graduates, especially in computer science and MIS. Since 2000, this number has declined precipitously, and, despite the modest upswing since 2010-2011, organizations and universities still struggle with numbers. This study examines a partnership between one university and a global IT firm to help increase IT majors through an annual high school IT camp focused on invigorating interest in technology careers. These (hopefully) fun, four-day, in-residence camps, held annually since 2007, feature technology training, appropriate tours, engagement with technology professionals, and education on the nature of IT work and job prospects. Based on extensive data collection from five camps (2010-2014), participants (particularly males) significantly increased their career awareness and positive attitudes toward an IT career and were more determined to choose IT as a major and career. While we did not meet all objectives, the IT camps played a crucial role in boosting interest in IT as a career and enhancing perceptions and beliefs of IT.

%X The “war for talent” is still on. Annually conducted surveys have indicated for years that one third of all organizations are unable to fill vacant job positions with suitable candidates. Responding to these and other challenges, human resource management (HRM) is expected to transform itself. General opinion holds that the HRM transformation has just begun and that the potential of IT in HRM is not yet fully exploited. Examining the value potential of IT in HRM, existing IS research predominately studies the impact of IT on HRM. We contribute by examining the reverse impact in three steps. First, we use Thompson's theory of organizations in action to examine the expected impact of the HRM transformation on IT ("to-be" situation). Second, we use Kohli and Grover's IT value typology and review 20 years of the publication history ("as-is" situation). Finally, we relate expectations to actual review findings. We find that the HRM transformation should lead to a major shift in technology type used in organizations. However, this shift is not recognized yet, which is why our literature review reveals considerable unaddressed value potential of IT in HRM. We finish the paper by outlining IS research avenues in the context of HRM.

%X The extent of co-authorship in IS research is on the rise. Why has collaboration between IS academics increased? While prior research on the incidence of co-authorship provides several reasons for why academics collaborate, little is known about whether these rationales are equally adept at explaining the growing extent of co-authorship. To answer this question, we delve into extant research on collaboration and delineate four rationales for why papers have more co-authors. These include information processing, access to social resources, convenience, and the opportunity cost of time. We formulate several variables and propose several hypotheses based on these rationales. We collected data by coding 641 papers from six major U.S. and European journals. The results generally support the proposed hypotheses. We discuss the implications of the results in terms of how they inform the field and policy makers.

%X Management information systems (MIS) is typically not the most popular major for students in business administration because, for one, incoming undergraduate business students are often unaware of what studying MIS entails and what career opportunities await those who choose this major. Another major with similar problems is operations and supply management (OPS). Whereas incoming students have some preconceived notion of what the marketing or finance field is about, they tend to be left in the fog when it comes to having a corresponding idea about MIS and OPS. In this paper, we describe the approach we have taken to remedy this situation at our university. Essentially, we developed short, “painless”, enjoyable, one-credit pass/fail courses made available to students pursuing a BS degree in business administration who have yet to decide on a specific major (concentration). After four years, the courses have proven to be remarkably successful. We describe our approach to help not only other MIS and OPS programs but also other fields seeking to help students make good major/career choices.

%X Culture is an important topic in strategic information systems (IS) research, particularly because information technology (IT) projects are often accompanied by cultural challenges. While culture has been widely analyzed in this discipline, there is a lack of research that systematically examines the role of culture in strategic IS research. With a structured literature review, we investigate the relation patterns between culture, strategy, and IS-related concepts in terms of dependent, moderating, and independent variables and the research approach in terms of descriptive, normative, and prescriptive. Four different patterns emerge, each one closely related to specific forms of theorizing and corresponding research designs. Research streams focusing on descriptive explanations of culture’s role are rather exhausted. IS research that builds on a normative understanding of culture exists in selected areas, while theorizing on the prescriptive management of culture has been largely neglected despite the relevance of cultural challenges in IS projects. We derive areas for future research and present two themes that emerged in our study to demonstrate how descriptive and normative approaches can provide a foundation for research on the prescriptive management of culture in strategic IS projects: the management of cultural clashes and the management of cultural identity.

%X Partnerships between business schools and practice are an area of underused potential. In their recent report, the AACSB (2012) recognizes the need for a stronger connection between education and practice and stresses that schools need to articulate the impacts of their investments in scholarship on students’ educational experiences and on the broader communities they serve. In this paper, we discuss our partnering experience that we undertook to integrate an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system into our curriculum. ERP systems pose a significant technical challenge due to their complexity. We discuss the importance of developing a partnership with practice and how such a partnership offers a solution to our problem of working with a complex system in our courses. We detail a partnership with a consulting company with significant experience with ERP systems and a commitment to education. We outline how a practice partner can collaborate with faculty to enhance students’ educational experience. Developing good working partnerships between practice and academe, if done effectively, can provide an opportunity to bring educational value to a new height.

%X Based on the International Conference on Information Systems’ (ICIS) 2014 senior scholars’ forum, we share insights on the relationship between evolving university business models and the adoption of electronic pedagogy. In recent years, particularly with the initiation of MOOCs, the potential for delivering high-quality and widely distributed coursework has expanded. However, particular instances of MOOCs and other electronic pedagogies do not guarantee equally high-quality educational outcomes for all participants. For example, some studies have suggested that most individuals completing MOOC coursework already have baccalaureate degrees, which contrasts with the idea that individuals undertake such coursework as a substitute for traditional degree programs. With this paper, we present varied experiences and views on using electronic pedagogy and report on both the conclusions and new questions raised about adopting these technologies for universities.

%X Ubiquitous networking facilitates Internet access across multiple network environments, whose value is tied directly to user perceptions of its ability to securely execute transactions. Prior research has cited awareness, trust, and risk as critical determinants of adoption but has failed to examine these factors as they relate to infrastructure and its provider. Because information in transit is at risk from a network environment’s vulnerabilities, we focus on the implications of such risk on Internet activities. We examine the multiple parties that must be trusted to complete and facilitate an online transaction. We propose that the user must trust not only the information recipient to act benevolently but also the technologies and organizations that facilitate the online exchange.

The tutorial serves as a ten-year update on an earlier CAIS tutorial (Pick, 2004). During the decade, GIS has expanded with wider and deeper range of applications in government and industry, widespread consumer use, and an emerging importance in business schools and for IS. In this paper, we provide background information on the key ideas and concepts of GIS, spatial analysis, and latest trends and on the status and opportunities for incorporating GIS, spatial analysis, and locational decision making into IS research and in teaching in business and IS curricula.

%X In this paper, we focus on interpersonal boundary regulation as a means to balance the tradeoffs between engaging with others and protecting one’s privacy on social networking sites (SNSs). We examine boundary regulation from the combined perspectives of SNS design and end user behavior; we conduct a feature-oriented domain analysis of five popular SNS interfaces and 21 semi-structured SNS user interviews. We use this information to construct a taxonomy of 10 types of interpersonal boundaries SNS users regulate to manage their privacy preferences. We then develop and validate scales to operationalize these 10 boundary types to measure the multi-dimensional nature of SNS users’ privacy preferences by using a sample of 581 Facebook users. Our taxonomy provides a theoretical foundation for conceptualizing SNS user privacy, and our scales provide a more robust way to measure SNS users’ multi-faceted privacy preferences.

%X Peer reviewing is critical in the process of legitimizing new scientific knowledge. Yet, concerns about its quality exist, especially if one considers developmental reviewing as an ideal. In this essay, I suggest three ways to improve review quality: provide reviewers with systematic feedback about their performance, reward active and good reviewers, and make reviewers more accountable by revealing their identities to the authors in certain conditions.

%X Scholarly peer review is both central to scientific progress and deeply flawed. Peer review is prejudiced, capricious, inefficient, ineffective, and generally unscientific. Management journals have longer review cycles than journals in other fields. Long cycle times demonstrably harm early-career researchers. Meanwhile, a lack of transparency conceals and facilitates editorial misconduct, and some dismiss legitimate criticism of peer review as unfounded resentment. We can address these problems by eliminating unnecessary reviewing, simplifying the peer review process, introducing author rebuttals, creating an AIS ombudsman, and enforcing the relationship between submitting and reviewing. These problems are, however, entangled with fundamental problems with journals. Ultimately, therefore, we can only fix peer review in conjunction with replacing journals with repositories.

%X This short paper is a rejoinder to Ivari’s (2016). It describes the Ivari’s arguments, corrective actions, and contributions on the peer-based review system problem in the information systems field. It manifests that, while Ivari’s posited solutions are worthy, they are also insufficient for achieving a behavioral change in the current peer-based review system. However, based on Ivari’s solutions, this short paper presents radical extensions as alternative solutions. Their implementation, however, will rely on the willingness of editorial teams of top and secondary-level journals to promote structural rather than superficial changes to the peer-based review system.

%X Juhani Ivari’s (2016) suggestions have merit as incremental steps that are directed towards fixing parts of a broken system—a system in which it often takes six to eight months to get an editorial decision on a paper, in which papers are rejected after five years and five rounds of reviews, and in which radically new ideas struggle to be published. Iivari’s suggestions all require the support of journal editors to be effective. These editors are embedded into a system that they have learned to navigate successfully. In fact, they may be too close to the system to make major changes to it. Perhaps people embedded in a review system in which they have been successful will not be able to develop viable solutions to a system that is really broken. Rather, it may be time for a radical change to the IS reviewing system that emanates from a groundswell of IS researchers who are suffering from the problems inherent in the existing malfunctioning system.

%X What’s the most valuable thing in scientific research? Data? Theory? Insight? Results? No; it is the reviewer. For, without the reviewer and the peer-review process, science becomes a specious thing, indeed. Who could trust prose not vetted by peers as being objective and generalizable? The reviewer is the backbone of the scientific publication process, and, yet, is among the most underappreciated and over-vilified party in science. Reviewers are often considered to be “late”, “wrong”, “biased”, and, worse in the minds of many who submit to the premier journals of our field. In this paper, I deal with the issue of publication cycle times from behind the scenes and leverage my own views as someone who has commissioned innumerable reviews for potential journal articles as an editor and who freely recognizes the frailties of the process. Giving voice to a debate that recently transpired in our association’s listserv, I speak to, respond to, and expand on points related to the time it takes for reviewers to do the work they do for us as authors, and I offer some insights as to the factors implicit in free service peer reviewing in the service of science and publication.

Additionally, I list five basic activities that need to form the basic actions for proposed solutions. Finally, I make six potentially controversial proposals for improving the review process. The key proposals include performing a faculty task analysis that adds in and includes time for performing reviewing and changing the tenure and promotion process to give credit for performing reviews.

I offer three responses to Iivari’s suggestions and add two further suggestions for change.

%X Making sense of an organization overwhelmed with data becomes a problem for decision makers at all levels of business planning and operation. Although scholars have suggested several technological solutions such as business intelligence as being useful in helping busy executives to make decisions, we still know little about assisting business stakeholders in the process of understanding their organizational complexity before such decisions could even be formulated. In this paper, we investigate the opportunities in using BI technologies to make sense of a business environment. We analyze the views and opinions of developers, analysts, consultants, and users of business intelligence, who are experienced in using the technology beyond decision making to support organizational sensemaking. Our results highlight the need for creating and maintaining individual; and organizational identity and enacting this identity on the business and its environment.

For many of these reasons, we embarked on several research initiatives over the past several years with mixed results. In this tutorial, we draw on several studies (some abandoned) to explore the use of information and communication technologies for humanitarian purposes, and we synthesize and highlight the distinct features of humanitarian operations research. Specifically, we draw attention to differences between “the process” of conducting these studies relative to traditional research and focus on challenges and opportunities for researchers.

%X There is an uptake of organizations’ involvement in collaborative organizational structures (COS). Consistent with the resource-centric views of the firm, we suggest that the COS members need to contribute their managed IT competencies to their COS, whose synergies would create COS IT competencies. We suggest three key IT competencies for COS: proactive top management decision synergy, collaborative and agile IT infrastructure, and cross-functional tactical management synergy. Using survey data, we found evidence of a positive association between these COS IT competencies and the collaborative rent-generating potential of the COS. We also found a positive association between the collaborative rent-generating potential of the COS and the business value of the COS members. The results suggest that developing COS IT competencies add value to a COS and its members. This study provides guidance for organizations looking to leverage their involvement in a COS.

%X In this paper, we focus on PLS-SEM’s ability to handle models with observable binary outcomes. We examine the different ways in which a binary outcome may appear in a model and distinguish those situations in which a binary outcome is indeed problematic versus those in which one can easily incorporate it into a PLS-SEM analysis. Explicating such details enables IS researchers to distinguish different situations rather than avoid PLS-SEM altogether whenever a binary indicator presents itself. In certain situations, one can adapt PLS-SEM to analyze structural models with a binary observable variable as the endogenous construct. Specifically, one runs the PLS-SEM first stage as is. Subsequently, one uses the output for the binary variable and latent variable antecedents from this analysis in a separate logistic regression or discriminant analysis to estimate path coefficients for just that part of the structural model. We also describe a method—regularized generalized canonical correlation analysis (RGCCA)—from statistics, which is similar to PLS-SEM but unequivocally allows binary outcomes.

%X In this paper, we examine the evolution of the institutional and intellectual structures of the IS field. We argue that, though the field’s institutional structures—academic programs, journals, conferences, and professional associations—have developed admirably, the state of the field’s intellectual structure is less clear. We employ a co-citation lens to analyze the development and evolution of subfields across three periods. We rely on Culnan’s (1987) second co-citation study as a point of departure for our analysis. We then extend her work through two additional studies that individually assess the state of subfield development at distinct periods during the field’s history. Over the three periods, we note that the field has experienced change in subfield diversity and cohesion. Culnan’s study exhibits low levels of cohesion and diversity among topics. Our first study shows continued isolation but growth in subfield diversity. This period is indicative of a fragmented adhocracy. Our second study suggests increasing levels of integration despite only a slight reduction in subfield diversity. While we largely only describe the field’s evolution, any assessment of whether this evolution represents a positive or negative trajectory for the field will be subject to interpretation and debate.

%X Since its inception, North American information systems (IS) research has relied on a broad and varied collection of theories. The core of this theoretical landscape is an important determinant of the IS research community’s identity, and, as such, researchers have discussed it extensively in recent years. Nevertheless, we know few concrete facts about the composition, consistency, or evolution of this theoretical core over time. Using a set of 318 theories in conjunction with n-gram analyses, we address these issues empirically by computationally analyzing the complete text of every research paper published in three leading North American IS journals over a 24-year period. In examining these 2,215 papers and more than 3.54 billion n-gram records, we identify the theories that constitute the overall core of North American IS research and provide insights into the evolution of that core. We further identify and quantify the nature of theoretical pluralism in North American IS research and examine the evolution of the theoretical density of IS research studies over time. Finally, our results shed light on the patterns of theory co-occurrence in North American IS research studies and demonstrate how such information can facilitate increasingly imperative efforts aimed at theory consolidation and generalization.

We discuss the roots of user satisfaction research as it pertains to satisfaction studies in marketing research and how these studies have been used to inform the IS context. We also discuss how the study of user satisfaction and use of the construct in IS research has evolved and matured over time. Finally, we discuss antecedents and outcomes of user satisfaction identified in IS research and provide suggestions for future research.

%X In this paper, we review the professional and academic development of the human resource information systems (HRIS) field to assess its progress and suggest ways for moving research forward. To do so, we examine the interplay between the evolution of technology and the HR field through four key eras of technology: 1) mainframe, 2) client server, 3) ERP and Web-based systems, and 4) cloud-based systems. In each era, we discuss how HR practices and requirements drove the need for the use of these systems and how these systems allowed the HR field to evolve. In addition, we trace the HRIS subfield and its relation to the technological evolutions occurring in the HR field. Somewhat surprisingly, we found that much of the research on the use of technology to support HR has occurred only in the last 15-20 years as a response to the use of the Web as a medium for delivering HRIS. We conclude by discussing how scholars from the information systems and human resources fields can come together to help advance HRIS.

%X Over the past two decades, the information systems community has become engaged in improving the environmental effects of information systems and technologies, which has given rise to the green IS field. Despite increasing interest, some have suggested that progress toward meaningful solutions for sustainability has been too slow. Responding to these concerns, we examine the development of green IS research using the modernity perspective to understand green IS’s evolution and to present alternative perspectives to motivate future research. From a sample of over 80 green IS papers published over a 15-year period, we identify four main patterns of modernity that are manifest in green IS research. These patterns include the importance of the individual in solving environmental problems; science as the main source of solutions; and the emergence of an artificial science approach, reliance on technology, and growth as businesses’ ultimate goals. Further, our analysis reveals that green IS research has started to demonstrate elements of a hyper-modernity perspective that emphasizes reflexivity. We argue that future green IS research should continue on this path and propose a conceptual framework inspired by hyper-modernity and centered on reflexivity that could serve as a guide for future research.

%X Few studies have synthesized accumulated scholarly knowledge on software piracy across the disciplines that study this phenomenon. We contribute to understanding the intellectual and social development on software piracy by performing a cross-disciplinary literature search. We used 17 research questions to address five specific areas of inquiry on software piracy research: 1) what makes up software piracy’s intellectual substance?, 2) do theoretical contributions on software piracy suggest a cross-disciplinary research community on the topic?, 3) what changes have occurred in software piracy research across the seven measured periods?, 4) what are the top IS journals’ publishing patterns on software piracy research?, and 5) who has contributed to software piracy research? To address these questions, we classified 179 software research studies. We found that: 1) over 50 percent of the studies focused on an individual level of analysis, 2) most papers examined software piracy in North America and Asia Pacific regions, although other regions also have major problems, and 3) the distribution of theoretical and methodological contributions show a pattern of leaning towards positivism. The findings point to several research opportunities including expanding research: 1) at organizational levels with particular emphasis on organizations’ role as consumers and or intermediaries, 2) in Latin America and Africa, which are areas with high incidence of software piracy, and 3) on approaches beyond positivism.

%X The doctoral consortium is a well-established, widely endorsed event in the information systems (IS) discipline that occurs adjunct to mainstream IS conferences (e.g., ICIS, ECIS, PACIS, AMCIS). Anecdotal evidence suggests that PhD students’ experience of these events is almost universally positive; some have referred to the events as “life changing” or “magical”. Further, both participating students and scholars strongly perceive the events’ value. To extend the experience to more PhD students, doctoral consortia are more recently being run locally and unaffiliated with any conference. By reviewing the literature and historical documents and conducting a series of interviews and email exchanges with past conference co-chairs, we explore the merits of IS doctoral consortia (consortia). We position the IS doctoral consortium as distinct from forms of doctoral student development in other disciplines, a veritable “signature pedagogy” for IS. In examining the practices and motivations underlying doctoral consortia, we explain related phenomena to improving future consortia. In addition, by appending much historical detail, we add to the IS discipline’s organizational memory.

%X “Is this the problem?”: the question that haunts many information systems (IS) researchers when they pursue work relevant to both practice and research. Nevertheless, a deliberate answer to this question requires more than simply asking the involved IS practitioners. Deliberately formulating problems requires a more substantial engagement with the different stakeholders, especially when their problems are ill structured and situated in complex organizational settings. On this basis, we present an engaged approach to formulating IS problems with, not for, IS practitioners. We have come to understand engaged problem formulation as joint researching and as the defining of contemporary and complex problems by researchers and those practitioners who experience and know these problems. We used this approach in investigating IS management in Danish municipalities. In this paper, we present the approach to formulating problems in an engaged way. We discuss it in relation to ideas and assumptions that underpin engaged scholarship, and we discuss the implications for IS action research, design science research, and mixed approaches.

%X In recent times, digital multi-sided platforms (DMSPs) have revolutionized electronic commerce by enabling new forms of competition and collaboration. Existing studies provide useful insights yet do not recognize the role of information technologies (IT) in examining the development of DMSPs. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a case study of Alibaba.com (henceforth simply Alibaba), the largest online B2B marketplace in the world with over 80 million members. We applied the theoretical notion of IT affordances to examine the possibilities for competitive action at a platform level based on organizational variables and IT features in the context of the environment in which they function. Our findings show that, toward market leadership, Alibaba has developed competitive actions from actualizing IT affordances. At Alibaba, actualizing IT affordances links closely with its defined organizational goals of developing: (1) a collectivist structure, (2) a coopetitive structure, and (3) an autonomous community among platform constituents. Our stage-wise model captures the relational aspects of IT affordances and proposes actionable prescriptions for a DMSP to achieve market leadership.

%X This study presents a framework to understand and explain the design and configuration of digital payment platforms and how these platforms create conditions for market entries. By embracing the theoretical lens of platform envelopment, we employed a multiple and comparative-case study in a European setting by using our framework as an analytical lens to assess market-entry conditions. We found that digital payment platforms have acquired market entry capabilities, which is achieved through strategic platform design (i.e., platform development and service distribution) and technology design (i.e., issuing evolutionary and revolutionary payment instruments). The studied cases reveal that digital platforms leverage payment services as a mean to bridge and converge core and adjacent platform markets. In so doing, platform envelopment strengthens firms’ market position in their respective core markets. This study contributes to the extant literature on digital platforms, market entries, and payment.

Findings from three separate events (an AIS- and Elsevier Foundation-sponsored survey, a pre-ICIS workshop panel update on the state of current research in the area of women and IS, and an in-depth discussion between workshop attendees at the 2015 AISWN Pre-ICIS Workshop on Advancing Women in IS), clearly indicate issues remain. Therefore, we also develop an agenda for future work to help advance women in the IS discipline.

%X While many studies have investigated the relationship between information systems (IS) characteristics and IS use, the results have been inconsistent. We argue that this inconsistency may be due to the modeling of information and system quality and the importance of the system usage context. We extend Wixom and Todd’s (2005) integrated model of IS satisfaction by proposing and modeling information and system quality as second-order constructs and by testing the model in the system administration context. Our findings provide support for modeling information and system quality as second-order constructs in the integrated model. Furthermore, our findings support using additional constructs, unique to the context studied, in the integrated model. We contribute to current literature by 1) enhancing the construct validity of information and system quality, which ultimately improves statistical conclusion validity and internal validity for studies that focus on information and system quality; and 2) testing the extended model in the system administration context. Our findings suggest that future research should measure information quality and system quality as second-order constructs and that including context-specific information and system characteristics provides researchers and practitioners with a better understanding of IS characteristics important in system administration.

%X The allure of the IS major depends on the successful placements of recent IS graduates in rewarding careers. The rise of the data science field provides an opportunity to rebrand and rebuild IS departments using the career-placement successes of IS graduates as a springboard. This paper describes a framework that IS departments can use to coordinate between the employer demand side and the graduate supply side of the data science job market. We developed the framework based on empirical evidence gained over several years in successfully placing IS graduates into IS consulting firms across the US. The framework contains four different perspectives: the university IS department, the organizations hiring IS graduates, the IS graduates themselves, and career-development professionals at the university and college level. IS departments seeking to place their graduates in the data science field can use this framework.

%X Research has shown that excessive email use leads to feelings of being overwhelmed and stressed. Existing coping solutions, which mitigate email overload, address the number of emails and, in consequence, the time spent on emails. These approaches are congruent with existing research on antecedents of email overload. Further coping solutions include addressing email threads. However, we lack a theoretical grounding for perceiving email threads as an antecedent of email overload. I suggest cognitive load theory as a means of investigating the format of forwarded email threads in an experiment. I found support for the effects on reading time and performance in terms of correct answers per second, findings that confirm that forwarded email threads are an antecedent of email overload and that we need a new conceptualization of email overload.

%X The growing importance of information security as a business issue has encouraged instructors to extend their courses beyond a hands-on, technical model to one that considers managerial and risk-based issues. In business schools, this shift has presented the pedagogical challenge of balancing the technical content fundamental to information security with the managerial content that the profession increasingly values. To draw on the best practices currently being undertaken in the classroom, we examine 44 information security course syllabi from business and other schools (i.e., computer science, engineering, information science, law, and mathematics). Using a qualitative approach, we identify the definitive technical and managerial-focused aspects of information security courses. Based on the results, we propose an introductory information security course that balances technical and non-technical content for business school students and that integrates the most innovative techniques used by today’s information security instructors.

%X Researchers have proposed but not tested that early-stage adopters of ERP systems tend to be higher-performing firms that adopt as a means of gaining or maintaining a competitive advantage. In contrast, they have proposed that late-stage adopters are underperforming firms that experience institutional pressures and make adoption decisions partly in response to those pressures and to try to improve performance and catch-up to industry leaders. In this study, we examine the relationship between firm performance and ERP adoption. We found that late-stage adopters tend to have lower financial performance relative to the overall market in the years leading up to adoption decisions as compared to early-stage adopters that tended to outperform the market in years leading up to adoption decisions. This finding demonstrates the relationship between firm performance and ERP adoption. We also found that, post-adoption, the relative performance of late-stage adopters tends to improve more than early-stage adopters. This finding suggests that following the actions of industry leaders and adopting ERP systems can have economic benefits for underperforming firms.

%X Lack of communication is a leading root cause of sentinel events (any unanticipated event in a healthcare setting resulting in a patient’s death or serious physical or psychological injury and not related to the natural course of the patient's illness). Deficits in communication of essential information when patients transfer between different healthcare services can cause interruptions in the continuity of care, inappropriate treatment, and potential harm to the patient. Research has shown that providing the right information about the right patient to healthcare providers at the right time could eliminate up to 18 percent of the general adverse events. In this paper, we assess the applicability of the work system framework (WSF) to evaluate the health information-exchange processes that occur when patients are transferred from home healthcare services and nursing homes to hospitals. From our analysis, we identify possible improvements in both work practices and the flow of health information among healthcare providers. Further, we propose a modified work system snapshot template tailored for evaluating the health information-exchange process. The proposed modifications include changing the WSF terminology to healthcare terms (including patient safety indicators) and adding new performance measurement indicators that are relevant to healthcare.

%X Business analytics is a fast-growing job market for business school graduates. Hence, researchers have made many calls to enhance business analytics training in business schools to meet the growing market demand for analytics-savvy employees. A growing set of business analytics courses have begun to address these calls. In this paper, we examine the maturity of business analytics offerings in business schools in the United States by analyzing current business analytics-related course offerings of the top 104 business schools (363 courses) and 20 unranked business schools (51 courses) in the United States. We analyze these data by examining the types of courses offered and rank the schools based on their maturity levels in terms of business analytics offerings. Our findings indicate that, to the extent that these schools reflect what is happening across the nation, business schools still have a long way to go before they reach higher levels of business analytics maturity and that they are not yet in an ideal position to serve the presumed industry needs. We offer actionable recommendations.

%X Analysts have estimated that more than 80 percent of today’s data is stored in unstructured form (e.g., text, audio, image, video)—much of it expressed in rich and ambiguous natural language. Traditionally, to analyze natural language, one has used qualitative data-analysis approaches, such as manual coding. Yet, the size of text data sets obtained from the Internet makes manual analysis virtually impossible. In this tutorial, we discuss the challenges encountered when applying automated text-mining techniques in information systems research. In particular, we showcase how to use probabilistic topic modeling via Latent Dirichlet allocation, an unsupervised text-mining technique, with a LASSO multinomial logistic regression to explain user satisfaction with an IT artifact by automatically analyzing more than 12,000 online customer reviews. For fellow information systems researchers, this tutorial provides guidance for conducting text-mining studies on their own and for evaluating the quality of others.

The speakers and participants agreed that that service systems are fundamental for service innovation and value creation. In this context, service systems are related to cognitive systems, smart service systems, and cyber-physical systems and depend on the interconnectedness among system components. The speakers and participants regarded humans as the central entity in all service systems. In addition, data, they saw personal data in particular as key to service systems. They also identified several challenges in the areas of cognitive systems, smart service systems, cyber-physical systems, and human-centered service systems. We hope this workshop report helps in some small way to cultivate the emerging service science discipline and to nurture fruitful discussions on service innovation.

%X This paper describes how a startup business process outsourcing (BPO) provider named Liberty Source helped a large U.S.-based client reshore business services from an established Indian BPO provider. Founded in 2014, Liberty Source is a for-profit firm that provides a competitive alternative to offshoring while fulfilling its social mission to launch and sustain the careers of U.S. military spouses and veterans who face various employment disadvantages. Thus, the case describes reshoring in the context of impact sourcing. It addresses key impact sourcing issues pertaining to workforce development, scalability, and impact on employees. The impact was positive: the workers found the employment and stable salary were beneficial, “the military” culture fit well with the workers, and workers received considerable flexibility and greater career options. Liberty Source was able to reduce a client’s costs after reshoring the client’s processes because Liberty Source’s U.S. site had about 20 percent fewer full time equivalents (FTEs) FTEs than the original India location and because Liberty Source received subsidies. We found evidence that the offshore BPO provider and Liberty source experienced difficulties with finding enough skilled staff for the wages offered and both firms experienced attrition problems, although attrition was greater in India.

%X Governments today have a strong interest in promoting the development of the next-generation broadband networks. Some 134 national broadband plans are now in place around the world, and China is no exception. On August 1, 2013, China's State Council officially announced the ambitious Broadband China Plan with which it aims to build a ubiquitous, fast, and advanced national broadband network before 2020. Will the Broadband China Plan lead to another leap forward? In this paper, I critically evaluate China's recent broadband policy. I argue that China's plan marks a major paradigm shift in China’s information policy. For the first time, the country has formally recognized a broadband network as a strategic public facility and considered it as a necessity rather than an optional value-added telecommunications service. However, it remains a conventional supply-side industrial policy, and its effectiveness is highly uncertain.

%X Offshore software development using geographically distributed teams is an accepted practice in software development today. However, software development companies have largely only offshored the software development lifecycle’s coding and testing phases. However, lately, offshoring the requirements analysis (RA) phase has become increasingly viable for several reasons including the software industry’s maturation and improved communication technologies. However, successfully evaluating this highly interactive phase between geographically dispersed client and provider teams requires special considerations. In this paper, we present practical insights garnered from conducting experiments and surveys of IS professionals from the Indian software industry and from extensively examining the literature. Our findings confirm that, subject to certain best practices, one can effectively conduct RA in software projects offshore. We present these practices as lessons learned and provide related recommendations for industry and academia.

%X Traditionally, IT firms closely guard the management and control of critical information assets. A group of IT firms, however, adopted a different approach and formed an organization with the goal of sharing critical IT security information with industry peers (firms in the same industry that do not directly compete) and competitors to more effectively manage IT security. The inherent vulnerability in sharing critical information with other (potentially competing) firms presents an interesting, coopetition paradox for firms. Drawing from the theoretical foundations of the relational view of the firm that resolves the coopetition paradox, we conducted an empirical test to determine whether security information sharing impacts firm's financial performance. Our findings suggest that IT firms engaged in interfirm security information sharing outperform their industry peers in terms of operational costs and overall profitability.

%X Although research recognizes the role of IT and organizational agility on firm performance, a research gap to investigate IT-enabled agility at strategic and operational levels exists. In this study, we define operation-level agility as a firm’s ability to respond to market changes or emerging opportunities by quickly modifying its business routines. In contrast, we define strategic-level agility as a firm’s ability to define long-range investment decisions and implement them to accommodate strategic moves and business initiatives. We investigate how IT can empower these two levels of agility, and, in turn, how these two levels of agility can influence firm performance. We also examine the relative roles of the two levels of IT-enabled agility in manufacturing and service settings. We use survey data to validate the proposed hypotheses. The results indicate that, in general, IT leads to superior firm performance through agility at both levels. Further analyses, however, suggest that IT-enabled operation-level agility is a stronger success factor for service firms and IT-enabled strategic-level agility is more critical in manufacturing firms. Our findings provide a theoretical insight regarding the industry-specific values of IT-enabled agility at operation and strategic levels and practical implications for organizational IT deployment under specific industrial settings.

%X While research has demonstrated positive productivity and quality gains from using agile software development methods (SDMs), some experts argue that no single SDM suits every project context. We lack empirical evidence about the project contextual factors that influence when one should use these methods. Research suggests several factors to explain agile method appropriateness; however, generalizable empirical evidence supporting these suggestions is weak. To address this need, we used contingency theory and the information processing model to develop the agile contingent project/method fit model. Subsequently, we used the model to analyze the influence of project contextual factors and agile practices on software development professionals’ perceptions regarding agile SDM appropriateness. We tested the model using survey data collected from 122 systems development professionals who provided information regarding: 1) contextual factors surrounding a recent agile development project, 2) agile practices applied during the course of that project, and 3) perceptions regarding the relative fit (appropriateness) of the agile method used. Linear regression identified several significant relationships between project contextual factors, agile practices, and respondents’ relative fit perceptions.

%X Organizations apply information security risk assessment (ISRA) methodologies to systematically and comprehensively identify information assets and related security risks. We review the ISRA literature and identify three key deficiencies in current methodologies that stem from their traditional accountancy-based perspective and a limited view of organizational “assets”. In response, we propose a novel rich description method (RDM) that adopts a less formal and more holistic view of information and knowledge assets that exist in modern work environments. We report on an in-depth case study to explore the potential for improved asset identification enabled by the RDM compared to traditional ISRAs. The comparison shows how the RDM addresses the three key deficiencies of current ISRAs by providing: 1) a finer level of granularity for identifying assets, 2) a broader coverage of assets that reflects the informal aspects of business practices, and 3) the identification of critical knowledge assets.

%X Information is a term widely but carelessly used in our day-to-day language While used poorly as a common expression, a growing number of recent publications on information have identified the importance of the term for both IS research and practice. Most of these publications, seeking to anchor the term more specifically, attribute meaning to information to distinguish it from data. In this paper, we present several in-class exercises we have developed to help students understand the implications of this semantic distinction. While one can use these exercises to teach and explain any semantic theory of information, they were originally designed to reinforce a particular semantic theory of information—the difference theory of information (McKinney & Yoos, n.d.). We discuss the lessons we learned and the paper’s limitations and implications.

%X Using the social network analysis technique, we decomposed the knowledge networks of the information technology management (ITM) domain. We included a total of 893 papers published during the 1995-2014 period in the network analysis. From this domain, the network and ego level properties—such as, degree centralities, density, components, structural holes, and degree distribution—suggest that, unlike the other information systems communities, the ITM is a community with a unique character and distinct collaboration patterns. The results show that the ITM knowledge networks are fragmented and exhibit a power law distribution in which incoming nodes and links prefer to attach to the nodes that are already well connected. We discuss several implications that arise from the network configuration that could aid the future development of the ITM domain.

%X This tutorial presents an action net-based narrative research methodology that is particularly useful for describing, undertaking, and understanding process-oriented field research related to IT-enabled change. We use work in the fields of cognitive psychology, organization theory, and information systems to inform the approach. This methodology is part of an emerging body of IS narrative research, and we argue that adopting it can bring multiple insights about IS change initiatives and technology artifacts. By exploiting an action net-based narrative methodology at all stages of their empirical work, researchers can better see the interconnectivity of narratives and follow the change process as it unfolds. We present a checklist for researchers interested in conducting narrative research and describe two categories of insight: 1) emergence and 2) repair. Attending to these two categories of insight may shape the nature of findings reported in such IS studies.

However, big data represents only one of the ingredients to materialize this revolution, and we need to surmount many other socio-technical elements required to enable it and other various challenges. From the perspective of ministries of health in low and middle income countries (LMICs), I examine some of the drivers of this data revolution and some of the challenges and opportunities big data provides for strengthening health systems. Based on this analysis, I draw some key implications for LMICs governments on how they could seek to harness the potential of big data to address public health concerns they are currently engaged with or expect to do so in the future.

%X Agility has increasingly gained attention in the software and IT services industry over the last years and academia put a heavy emphasis on research about agile software development methods. However, an organization does not only comprise development teams, and research often lacks an organizational perspective on agility. Presently, we have no consensus about what constitutes an “agile organization”. Hence, in this study, I identify the structure behind the concept of organizational agility using an exploratory research approach. I conducted a survey among organizations in the software and IT service industry and performed an, exploratory factor analysis and a cluster analysis (based on the variables). The results show that one can describe organizational agility using six interrelated factors that one can further aggregate into the three basic dimensions of “agility prerequisites”, “agility of people”, and “structures enhancing agility”. The identified structure is a first step toward a common understanding of organizational agility and helps to guide further research activities while simultaneously supporting practitioners in assessing the agility of their organizations.

%X In this paper, we develop and validate a comprehensive theoretical model of electronic medical record (EMR) system adoption in Canadian medical practices. Canada lags other developed countries in the adoption of information technology (IT) in healthcare, and medical practice adoption of EMRs is particularly low. Most Canadian medical practices have the distinct feature of blending characteristics of both individual physicians and small clinics in private practice. We built a theoretical model combining individual-type and organizational-type perceptions (from one point of view) and opportunities and barriers (from another point of view) and tested it with 119 physicians from across Canada. Results show a reasonably valid model explaining 55.3 percent of the physicians’ intent to adopt EMRs in their clinics. We found that physicians would adopt EMRs if they saw these systems as first being easy to use and second as being useful. Physicians’ innovativeness regarding the use of new IT was an additional favoring factor. Conversely, physicians would choose not to adopt EMRs if they feared such systems would not perform as expected, would involve possible legal and privacy risks, would affect clinics’ productivity, and would not be a justified adoption altogether. Overall, we found that physicians saw more opportunities than obstacles in using EMRs in their practices.

%X Twitter, a popular micro-blogging service, is increasingly evolving from being a mere chatting platform to a tool that is instrumental in affecting a desired learning and social change among individuals and organizations. Although using Twitter for learning while socializing represents a significant departure from its intended initial function, information systems (IS) researchers should further explore the impact and implications of social media technologies such as Twitter in the educational context. We draws on engagement theory and social impact theory to assess how social media technologies tools can support learning and improve students’ academic outcomes. We present an experiment in which we compared Twitter and a traditional discussion board to academically engage students over a 14-week period. The results show that actively using both Twitter and traditional discussion boards for engagement is related to student performance in the course. Social network analysis suggests that, by using Twitter, the students possibly created shared mental models that led them to engage with the class more, and therefore, better their performance.

%X For decades, practitioners and scholars have focused on achieving optimal values in and benefits from enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Given that scholars have identified ERP systems as having option-like characteristics such as the capacity to create an information technology (IT) platform that enables the adoption of subsequent function-specific applications, we face a need to explore the linkage between post-ERP systems implementation and subsequent ERP-enabled technology adoption. We used real options theory to explore the underlying relationship between the initial ERP system implementation and subsequent technology adoptions. We surveyed 519 IT executives in the United States and found that the level of technology uncertainty, managerial flexibility, and formal real option analysis in ERP adoption decisions influenced the organizational relative advantage of subsequent non-ERP technologies. Our results also reveal that the level of uncertainty had a negative relationship with ERP-enabled technology adoption, while formal real option analysis in ERP adoption decisions positively influenced ERP-enabled adoption.

After capturing a traveler’s reservation, TRIPBAM software scrutinized the digital data stream of changing room rates and notified users of any potential savings. While TRIPBAM could successfully discover savings for its many customers, its executives focused on the challenge of turning TRIPBAM into a resilient, viable business going forward. Many questions awaited a clear answer. Was the consumer space the one that had the greatest potential or should the firm focus exclusively on the corporate market? How could TRIPBAM protect its early advantage from its inevitable imitators? Both the consumer and business opportunities looked wide open even though each side presented distinct challenges to growth. To achieve profitability, TRIPBAM needed to not just grow the user base but also seek a unique position in the market to defend against the increasing number of startups entering their space.
%X The case provides substantial data and information for students to step in the shoes of TRIPBAM’s executives and provide some answers to the above questions.

%X Situated in an emirate’s farming industry, this ethnographic study develops a framework to help bridge the existing knowledge gap about what and how local contexts interact with emerging technology, RFID in particular. Findings suggest that numerous local factors pertaining to the researched emirate’s unique environmental, project, cultural, and societal/political contexts shape and/or are reshaped by RFID implementation. For example, geographic landscape demands systems modification and device adaptation; religious custom increases project difficulty, and the systems, in turn, requires changes in certain religious practice; the notion of social sustainability establishes objectives for RFID project, while the latter helps reshape social welfare systems. As these local factors have rarely been empirically examined, my framework can help contribute to future RFID implementation in different local contexts. More specifically, insights gained urge stakeholders involved to carefully manage unique factors of the emirate or similar contexts for intended RFID projects. The findings also suggest that stakeholders should be aware of RFID’s reshaping effects on the local context particularly because those effects might be unexpected.

%X Targeting comprises defining the part of the business environment that corresponds to organizations’ strategic objectives and priorities. Targeting is not an easy process because it includes the interaction of managers who come from different organizational units that might have a fragmentary and blurred understanding of the overall issue. Through an action research, we designed and evaluated a GSS to help managers target strategic scanning in fuzzy contexts. Evaluations through interventions in 10 French organizations allowed both participants to achieve relevant targets and researchers to propose four major improvements to targeting activities: 1) use suggested lists of actors and topics as starting points to trigger and facilitate discussions, 2) define actor and topic importance to produce useful targeting results, 3) evaluate the organization’s perceived capacity to be informed early enough, and 4) define a mechanism to signal scanning relevancy in the short, mid-, or long term. From a management perspective, our results help managers in their strategic scanning activity by 1) identifying information needs for strategically scanning fuzzy subjects, 2) reducing risk of strategic scanning failure, 3) enabling organizations to assess their scanning capabilities, 4) identifying scanning priorities according to a temporal horizon, and 5) fostering teamwork participation.

%X This paper reports on a panel discussion at the pre-ICIS 2015 Workshop on Green Information Systems on the current state and future perspectives of SIGGreen—the Association of Information Systems’ special interest group on green information systems—and of green information systems (green IS) research in general. Over the past years, IS scholars have made important contributions advancing our knowledge about how information systems can contribute to solving problems associated with the degradation of the natural environment. However, it would appear that many view green IS as just another research topic in the IS field and not a very important one at that. This is questionable because sustainability is too important to be relegated as a footnote in the greater scheme of things. We suggest that the IS community should embrace sustainability as a core research imperative and integrate sustainability-related dimensions to research in theory and method, in rigor and relevance, and in the areas one chooses to research. We provide some actionable recommendations on how we as IS researchers and, indeed, how the IS field could help society and business interests make the transition to a sustainable world.

%X Interest in the rankings of contributors to academic literature is evidenced by the numerous publications across most business and economic disciplines. This study presents the most prolific authors 1) over the entire history of the 11 high-impact IS journals and 2) over the ten most recent years for each of the journals. We include the number of authors who have published in the journals but who may not be considered prolific based on our classification; this data is important and especially critical for IS departments that set research standards. Identifying and ranking authors in the IS discipline is interesting for several reasons. While some may be curious to see how they perform compared to these researchers, a more beneficial application of the findings in this paper pertains to establishing realistic promotion and tenure standards. Although 11,204 authors published in the 11 high-impact journals, 7,734 (69%) of those authors published only once in these journals in the 1977-2014 period. This fact is essential for any IS department that sets promotion and tenure guidelines. Using our findings will help colleges and IS departments establish reasonable and attainable promotion and tenure standards based on the actual performance of others in the discipline.

%X Many researchers and practitioners recognize that there is a link between the failures of information system (IS) provision and flawed Information Requirements Definition (IRD). Misinformation arises from defective communication between clients and analysts and lead to situations where the actual requirements of clients are not identified and properly represented in the subsequent information system. Recent research suggests that this could be the result of inquiry methods that do not subscribe to known learning theories and instead focus on contextual factors affecting client learning. In this paper, we explore the underpinning ideas of client-driven requirements definition and attempt to find a way of “navigating” the gap between what the client wants and what the technical expert can provide. The approach described stimulates client learning, which we suggest is a fundamental component of a successful outcome. We propose a method of requirements analysis that has shown its value in helping to overcome the communication gap between client and developer while creating a collaborative learning environment. The lessons learnt from this research may provide an interface for other technology driven development methods.

Given the scope of impact of these innovations, tech giants will be under increasing pressure to architect a world wherein devices and platforms are secondary to what users want to achieve via technology. Participants examined competing approaches to connectivity and continuity, explored emergent issues for research and practice, and discussed the social and business impacts of these technologies.

%X The integration of neuroscientific methods in Information Systems (IS) research to better understand how the brain interacts with IS-relevant context has gained in importance. Many papers that highlight the potential of neuroIS and that discuss methodological issues associated with using functional brain imaging already exist. However, neuroIS researchers have to keep in mind that the emergence of complex mental processes such as trust in IS contexts is based on activity in a network of brain regions rather than on activity in one area alone. Accordingly, we introduce psycho-physiological interaction (PPI) analysis, a technique that one can use to analyze fMRI data. Specifically, we review how one can conduct PPI analysis, provide a concrete research example, and show how this analysis can inform IS trust research. Thus, we introduce neuroIS researchers working in the domain of functional brain imaging to advanced fMRI analyses methods and show, based on the example of trust, how these methods can enhance our understanding of the nature of IS constructs.

We divided the subjects into four experimental groups: those who received only feedback, those who received only feedforward, those who received both feedback and feedforward, and those who received neither feedback nor feedforward. We found that both feedforward and feedback impacted behavior change but that the effect was much greater for individuals who ranked low in conscientiousness than for individuals who ranked high in conscientiousness. In fact, the magnitude of the effect of feedforward and feedback was nearly the same as the magnitude of the effect of conscientiousness.

%X Because technostress research is multidisciplinary in nature and, therefore, benefits from insights gained from various research disciplines, we expected a high degree of measurement pluralism in technostress studies published in the information systems (IS) literature. However, because IS research mostly relies on self-report measures in general, reasons exist to also assume that technostress research has largely neglected multi-method research designs. To assess the status quo of technostress research with respect to the application of multi-method approaches, we analyzed 103 empirical studies. Specifically, we analyzed the types of data-collection methods used and the investigated components of the technostress process (person, environment, stressors, strains, and coping). The results indicate that multi-method research is more prevalent in the IS technostress literature (approximately 37% of reviewed studies) than in the general IS literature (approximately 20% as reported in previous reviews). However, our findings also show that IS technostress studies significantly rely on self-report measures. We argue that technostress research constitutes a nurturing ground for the application of multi-method approaches and multidisciplinary collaboration.

Based on the EITT, we propose a three-phased (i.e., learner, explorer and inventor) framework of an exchange experience assessment (EEA) course with all five EITT factors (i.e., stress, adaptation, growth, support and motivation) interfaced with three stakeholders (i.e., student, patent advisor and instructor). Also, we report the design of the EEA course and its implementation in a university. The collected data confirmed our proposed EITT and EEA course framework that helped to transform information systems (IS) students into inventors. We found that students could develop patentable inventions through the stress-adaptation-growth process during their academic exchanges, but they still needed the patent advisors’ and instructor’s support and motivation. Our findings can enable any interested faculty in any university to attempt offering a similar course for the benefit of budding undergraduate inventors during academic exchange.

In spite of these firms’ importance, they remain understudied in strategic alignment research. In this paper, we consolidate and extend the IS literature on strategic alignment in SMEs. We develop a set of theoretical propositions that outline the ways in which SMEs’ unique characteristics affect their ability to achieve and sustain alignment between their IS/IT strategy and their overall business strategy. In some respects, SMEs can achieve and sustain alignment as larger firms do, while, in other respects, they differ noticeably. We ground each of our propositions in the dynamic capabilities framework to strengthen the theoretical foundations of strategic alignment research, particularly in SMEs. We discuss the implications of our propositions and note theoretical issues emerging from the study of strategic alignment in the SME context.

%X Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing humanity today. Environmental values have spread globally and consumer beliefs are pressurizing firms in almost all industries to comply with green regulations. Sustainability has become such an important part of business strategy that almost every major company now has an executive with “sustainability” in their title. The travel and tourism industry produced 14 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2010. Policy makers have responded with ambitious targets. The European Union aims to achieve a 60 percent reduction in transport sector emissions by 2050. This exploratory study draws on the sustainable ICT capability maturity framework (SICT-CMF) and the case of the Amadeus IT Group, a large travel and tourism industry corporate enterprise that specializes in IT solutions. The study investigates the current capability maturity level of sustainable ICT in the company. The findings suggest that the company is a market leader in terms of sustainability initiatives and that it demonstrates an “advanced” level of sustainability capability. We discuss the lessons learned from Amadeus’ experience.

We tested the proposed research model using longitudinal data that we collected in two points in time six months apart from 125 users of the LinkedIn professional social networking site (pSNS). The results show that 1) perceived usability, usability confirmation, perceived usefulness, and usefulness confirmation determined user satisfaction with pSNS and 2) perceived usability along with satisfaction predicted continuance intention, whereas perceived usefulness had no effect. This study contributes IT continuance research by 1) proposing and empirically validating a decomposed model of IT continuance and 2) by bringing in usability as a core construct of interest for IT continuance research.

%X Deciding what to do during a sabbatical is one of the most exciting times for professors. An opportunity to recharge and renew and develop professional skills is an important contributor to staying current and relevant in research and in the classroom. This paper describes a professor-in-residence (PiR) sabbatical experience that was somewhat non-traditional. Instead of visiting an academic institution, a PiR sabbatical involves becoming embedded in a company (in this case, a small software company) and is the flip-side to the executive-in-residence concept popular in many business schools. This paper describes the experience and provides suggestions and insight for professors, hosts, and institutions when considering sabbatical options and how to plan for them.

%X Previous feedback system research in a variety of contexts has focused on the impact that ratings (as proxies for quality) have on a variety of social and economic outcomes with equivocal findings. These mixed findings may be partially due to noise (factors not related to quality) embedded in aggregated or average positive and negative ratings. One significant source of ratings noise may come from culturally diverse raters’ issuing ratings in virtual environments. Culture impacts how groups of individuals are socialized to behave and think, which may result in members’ having different attitudes towards publicly downgrading (negative ratings) or praising (positive ratings) other members in the feedback system. In this paper, I investigate how culture influences rating practices specifically in public electronic knowledge sharing communities. Using a cross-nested hierarchical linear model, I demonstrate empirically that cultural differences at the community, occupation, and national levels interact in unique ways to increase or decrease an individual’s propensity to give and receive a positive or a negative rating. My study contributes to the literature on rating systems along with having practical ramifications for the designers of feedback systems.

%X Factorial survey analysis is a statistical technique with a long history of use in decision-oriented organizational and information systems (IS) research. The technique produces a collection of standardized regression coefficients that help one to rank survey factors by importance. However, such rankings may be invalid because a researcher might not account for two related issues: unequal factor (i.e., dimension) manipulation effect sizes and the inherent multilevel structure of factorial survey data. We address these concomitant issues by demonstrating the ranking problem in simulated datasets, explaining the ranking problem’s underlying statistical causes, and justifying the use of remediating statistical methods. In particular, we focus on coding proportional to effect, a technique in which one consolidates corresponding dimension-level dummy (0, 1) variables into a single re-calibrated independent variable that is regressed on the dependent variable. One then uses the resulting standardized coefficients to rank the factors. We assess the advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of remediation techniques and offer suggestions for future information systems research.

%X Appropriate evaluation of information systems research papers ensures that our institutions and review processes stay viable. In the short run, we typically assess research value through research awards, while, in the longer term, we typically assess research value based on how the research community sees and draws from particular published research papers. In this study, we examine the consistency between two metrics for assessing research value: research awards and citations. To do so, we focus on a premier journal, MIS Quarterly. We found that rarely are the “papers of the year” the ones cited the most. We offer possible explanations for this discrepancy based on assessing papers’ originality and utility and their citation patterns.

%X Most research on the impact of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems implementation on business process outcomes have focused on developed nations. However, Sub-Saharan Africa, a developing region, is a growing ERP market and provides a new context for theory development. We examine the antecedent and outcomes of extent of ERP systems implementation in Sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, we examine three research questions: 1) “How does an organization’s data culture influence the extent of ERP implementation?”, 2) “How does the extent of ERP implementation influence the ethical behavior and data integration of the organization?”, and 3) “How do ethical behavior and organizational integration influence the business process outcomes?”. We used the panoptic concept as a theoretical lens to develop a research model and six hypotheses to answer the research questions. We tested the model by using the survey methodology to collect data from 115 firms that have implemented ERP systems and operated in 13 industries in Ghana, a Sub-Saharan Africa nation. We used structural equation modeling to analyze the data. We found support for all six hypotheses. We offer both theoretical and managerial implications.

%X Gamification refers to the use of game mechanics and game dynamics in non-gaming environments and contexts. Gamification is increasingly gaining attention among system designers across various industries especially in education due to the benefits associated with its implementation. The adoption of gamification in information systems (IS) education is promising for engaging and motivating students to complete their degree programs. Call for research in this area is particularly on the increase in the IS field. Accordingly, we need to organize the aggregation of research in this area and use common terminologies to promote progressive research practice in the field. In this paper, we use a multi-method approach to systematically review existing research on gamification in IS education to identify common terminologies, identify trends in topics studied, highlight understudied areas, and, thus, present opportunities for future research. The multi-method approach combines classical systematic review method and social network analysis to provide additional insight into the knowledge structure of researchers involved in the gamification of IS education. This review also highlights possible interventions that can improve student retention in IS education through the design of effective gamified courses.

%X Industry reports continue to highlight the importance and growth of e-learning. However, researcher, trainers, and trainees all agree that such training has significantly higher levels of anxiety compared to traditional learning. Thus, anxiety is one of the most important impediments in online learning because it can significantly negatively impact training outcomes. On the other hand, researchers and practitioners have not focused on the positive psychological state of process satisfaction from the training process. This paper presents a research model that reframes the dominant theory in technology training (i.e., socio-cognitive theory) and its impact on learning, which includes the impact of perceived anxiety and process satisfaction in a team-based self-paced online technology-training context. Results of the empirical study show that verbal persuasion structures can reduce perceived anxiety and increase process satisfaction and, thus, improve training outcomes. The results also show that verbal persuasion has an indirect effect on outcomes rather than a direct effect as socio-cognitive theory conceptualizes. The paper presents theoretical and practical implications for researchers, trainers, and designers.

The first theme addresses our responsibility, as a research community, to come up not only with descriptions of the world but also to try to change things into preferable states. The second theme emphasizes that knowledge production also happens through the design of artifacts. The third theme identifies an apparent pragmatic turn in our discipline.

%X Most organizations need to evaluate novel ideas to identify their value. However, current idea evaluation research and practice hinder creativity by primarily facilitating convergent production (narrowing down ideas to a few tangible solutions) but discounting divergent production (the development of wildly creative and novel thoughts patterns). In this paper, I challenge this dominant view on idea evaluation by presenting a new theory I call dynamic idea evaluation and exploring the theory through a group creativity support system (GCSS) prototype. I designed the GCSS prototype as an idea portal that uses the knowledge created from the evaluation process to facilitate both convergent and divergent production. I designed the GCSS using an inductive and theory-building design science research (DSR) approach and interpretively analyzed it through an exploratory study in a Danish IS research department. I found that the GCSS demonstrates the ability to facilitate both divergent and convergent production during idea evaluation. Moreover, I add four design requirements and process architecture to help designers to build dynamic idea evaluation into this class of systems.

We first argue that information systems is indeed a science in that it draws from and creates knowledge in a form similar to many different disciplines, including psychology, sociology, mathematics, economics, computer science, and engineering. We counter the flawed logic of methodical extremists who believe that their approach represents the best or only path to knowledge. Specifically, we argue that many different methods of inquiry and discovery are appropriate in information systems and that each has its strengths and weaknesses.

%X Many emergent ventures, such as social networks, leverage crowd-sourced information assets as essential pillars supporting their business models. The appropriation of rights to information assets through legal contracts often fails to prevent conflicts between the users and the companies that claim information rights. In this paper, we focus on social networks and examine why those conflicts arise and what their consequences are by drawing on psychological contract theory. We propose that intellectual property and privacy expectancies comprise core domains of psychological contracts between social networks and their users. In turn, perceived breaches of those expectancies trigger a psychological contract violation. We use the exit, voice, loyalty, and neglect typology to define the user behavioral outcomes. We evaluated our framework by surveying 598 Facebook users. The data support our framework and indicate that perceived breaches of privacy and intellectual property rights generate the affective experience of a psychological contract violation, which is strongly associated with exit intentions.

%X Mobile application providers face high user losses because users can easily and often switch to an alternative application. Researchers have recently started to study information technology (IT) switching. However, no studies have concentrated on the unique context of mobile applications. Mobile application switching differs from the switching behavior related to many other IT products and services because of the highlighted role of alternatives, beta versions, updates, reviews, and users’ spontaneous behavior. To address this gap, we develop a mobile-specific model by using a qualitative research approach. As a theoretical contribution, we introduce trialing behavior as a predecessor of switching behavior and present six new behavioral antecedents for them. As practical implications, we suggest ways for mobile application providers and developers to reduce user churn.

%X Despite significant research into why IT projects fail, the frequency and impact of failure remains high. Attention has shifted to understanding and guiding de-escalation (i.e., reversing failure). This major turnaround process initially benefits from negative feedback on the status quo and requires an organization to break its established frames and re-establish its legitimacy with stakeholders (Pan & Pan, 2011). We consider the role of satire as a lens to challenge dominant frames and better understand stakeholders during the shift towards de-escalation based on analyzing political cartoons about high-profile troubled public sector projects in New Zealand and Denmark. Drawing on the theories of technological frames of reference, legitimacy, and stakeholder salience, we show how cartoonists expose and critique the normative framing of dysfunctionality to act as field-level evaluators of legitimacy. Through counter-framing, exaggeration, and metaphor, they emphasize the urgency of citizen users’ claims while undermining the legitimacy of powerful stakeholders. We extract lessons for stakeholder management and communication during project turnaround and suggest that satire could be a valuable addition to diagnostic and planning tools during de-escalation. We identify that sensitivity to framing of IT projects exists in the public realm, which reinforces calls for organizations to consider institutional framing.

%X Methods for Agile information systems development (ISD) are widely accepted in industry. One key difference in comparison to traditional, plan-driven ISD approaches is that Agile ISD teams rely heavily on direct, informal face-to-face communication instead of indirect and formal documents, models, and plans. While the importance of communication in Agile ISD is generally acknowledged, empirical studies investigating this phenomenon are scarce. We empirically open up the “black box” of the Agile ISD process to enhance the knowledge about the communication mechanisms of Agile ISD teams. We conducted a case study at two medium-sized ISD companies. As our primary data collection technique, we carried out semi-structured interviews, which we complemented with observations and, in one case, a survey. Our study’s main contribution is a set of so-called social Agile practices that positively impact the direct communication of team members. Our data suggests including the Agile practices co-located office space, daily stand-up meeting, iteration planning meeting, pair programming, sprint retrospective, and sprint review in this set. Furthermore, we investigate the role of more formal, indirect communication in Agile ISD projects. We highlight areas in which formal documents remain important so that a trade-off between indirect and direct communication is necessary.

%X Theory provides the medium for organizing and communicating knowledge that enables scientific collaboration.  Review of five years of published work in two major IS journals, Management Information Systems Quarterly and Journal of Management Information Systems, describes the nature of this theoretical diversity in IS research.  Two-hundred-seventy-three articles were evaluated for theoretical citations to identify the range of theories in Information Systems.  Approximately half of the papers explicitly cited one of the 111 theories identified.  Thirty of the theories were cited multiple times, representing 55% of the citations.  The large number of theories used and the small number used more than once indicate that theoretical diversity clearly exists in information systems research.  Based on the results, no theory emerged as a potential candidate for the role of grand/unified theory of information systems.

%X Application maintenance is a critical, yet unheralded, activity in most IT organizations. Left unmanaged, maintenance costs can easily spiral out of control to consume the lion’s share of the IT budget. As the saying goes, “If you don’t manage maintenance, it will manage you.” To explore the organizational issues of application maintenance, the authors convened a focus group of senior IT managers from a variety of different companies representing several industries. This article is based on these discussions. It first examines the root causes of application maintenance and the importance of this issue. It then reviews the sourcing–maintenance debate and explains the “maintenance trap” that has plagued IT organizations for a long time. Application support is then investigated and linked to the four types of maintenance (i.e., corrective, adaptive, preventive, and perfective). The article concludes with a number of proven strategies suggested by the focus group to enable IT organizations to manage application maintenance … rather than the other way around.

%X Ethnographic research is one of the most in-depth research methods possible. Because the researcher is at a research site for a long time  - and sees what people are doing as well as what they say they are doing - an ethnographer obtains a deep understanding of the people, the organization, and the broader context within which they work.  Ethnographic research is thus well suited to providing information systems researchers with rich insights into the human, social, and organizational aspects of information systems. This article discusses the potential of ethnographic research for IS researchers, and outlines the most important issues that need to be considered in selecting this method.

%X The paper discusses the possibility of introducing quantitative and qualitative requirements on references/citations in academic publications having in mind the goal of creating recommendations on reference usage. Quantitative requirements concern the number of references, while qualitative requirements concern types of publications to which the references are made. To reach the goal, the classification of contexts of reference usage is suggested. It differentiates three categories of references, namely: (a) references to foundations of the current research, (b) references to the core knowledge in the discipline, and (c) references to (loosely) related research works. Possibilities of introducing quantitative and qualitative requirements for the first two categories of references are limited. For the third category of references, both quantitative and qualitative requirements can be justified.  Based on the suggested classification, the paper also discusses such issues as meaning of the impact factors and misuse of references. The paper is based solely on the experience of the author in reading, writing, editing, and reviewing academic publications, and it should be considered as a preliminary framework for further research.

This examination motivated a proposed distinctive anchoring theme for the IT discipline as deployment and configuration. Recommendations are made for advancing the research component of an IT agenda by seizing on jurisdictional vacancies, abstracting from professional practice, and drawing upon theoretical results from the systems sciences, serving as a reference discipline for IT. Five IT research thrust areas are proposed: IT artifacts, enterprise architectural infrastructure, interaction models, system performance, and domain induction.  Appendices provide context by discussing viewpoints on the IS-IT relationship, perspectives on the role of artifacts in IS-IT research, and observations on the perceived standing of IT as a discipline or sub-discipline.

%X The explicit representation of context and subjectivity enables an information system to support multiple interpretations of the data it records. This is a crucial aspect of learning and innovation within scientific information systems. We present an ontology-based framework for context and subjectivity that integrates two lines of research: data provenance and ontological foundations of the Semantic Web. Data provenance provides a set of constructs for representing data history. We extend the definition of these constructs in order to describe multiple viewpoints or interpretations held within a domain.

%X A recurrent problem in information-systems development (ISD) is that many design shortcomings are not detected during development, but first after the system has been delivered and implemented in its intended environment. Pilot implementations appear to promise a way to extend prototyping from the laboratory to the field, thereby allowing users to experience a system design under realistic conditions and developers to get feedback from realistic use while the design is still malleable. We characterize pilot implementation, contrast it with prototyping, propose a five-element model of pilot implementation and provide three empirical illustrations of our model. We conclude that pilot implementation has much merit as an ISD technique when system performance is contingent on context. But we also warn developers that, despite their seductive conceptual simplicity, pilot implementations can be difficult to plan and conduct. It is sometimes assumed that pilot implementations are less complicated and risky than ordinary implementations. Pilot implementations are, however, neither prototyping nor small-scale versions of full-scale implementations; they are fundamentally different and have their own challenges, which will be enumerated and discussed in this article.

%X After decades of progress, IT projects are still too likely to fail. Managing projects for success has become a critical goal for many organizations. Project portfolio management started in the Coors Brewing Company (CBC) as a way to improve the success rates of IT projects. Before the creation of an IT program management office (PMO) about 65 percent of running projects were rated as healthy (essentially on-time and on-budget); after the creation of the IT PMO, as many as 95 percent of the ongoing projects became rated as healthy. While the IT PMO was dramatically improving the efficiency of the IT organization, the New Product Packages (NPP) organization was implementing its own product program management office. Ultimately, the combined buzz of these two success stories within Coors led the CEO to sanction the creation of a U.S.-divisional PMO - known as the CBC PMO. With the recent merger with Molson Canada another layer was created called the Global PMO. What started as a strategic IT initiative ended up changing the entire culture and framework of the company - Coors had entered the elite group of companies that could prove stellar technology investment success rates. Now, while its vision is to create PMOs in its other two subsidiaries, Coors Brewers Limited (CBL) and Molson Canada, as it did with the creation of its CBC PMO, the company is running into some new challenges. This case study is split into four main sections: Introduction, Background (Coors history, project portfolio management history), IT PMO, and Global PMO. In the introduction we present the two organizations that have driven the creation of the Molson-Coors operational portfolio architecture: the IT PMO and the Global PMO. This summary then allows us to frame the four core problems of this paper in both the context of these two PMOs and in the context of the recent merger with Molson, Inc. After clarifying the goals of the paper, we then step back and review the history of the Coors Brewing Company and the history of project portfolio management. With the goals outlined and the background established, we start the section on the evolution of the IT PMO. Finally, in the last section, we show how the four core problems derived from the Global PMO and how lessons learned from the IT PMO may be applied. We hope that by framing the four problems from different perspectives (corporate history, industry approaches, IT PMO evolution and the Global PMO architecture) the reader will be able to more easily develop solutions.

Moreover, there are situations in which the goal of an information system is to influence end-users’ behaviors. This special section of Communications of the AIS is devoted to persuasive technology, i.e., interactive computing systems designed to change people’s attitudes or behaviors. The guest editorial introduces the topic to CAIS readers and provides both conceptual tools for obtaining a deeper understanding about persuasive technology and practical applications to demonstrate its potential for research and development in the future.

%X In recent years, open source software (OSS) has become widely known and adopted in practice. In academic literature, an increasing number of studies on the adoption of OSS have been published to investigate which factors influence its adoption. However, most of these studies have an exploratory nature, and empirical support based on a large-scale quantitative study is still missing. To address this issue, we present the results of a large-scale quantitative study investigating the factors that influence the assimilation of open source server software (OSSS) by organizations. OSSS refers to open source software products such as operating systems, web servers and mail servers. We developed a conceptual model that describes the factors influencing the assimilation of OSSS. We gathered data from 210 Belgian organizations and analyzed it using PLS to test this conceptual model. The proposed model was able to explain a large proportion of the variance in the dependent variable in the model. Surprisingly, we have found no support for the influence of several widely claimed advantages of OSSS. Our findings further show that the assimilation of OSSS is predominantly influenced by the availability of internal and external knowledge of OSSS.

This elective course introduces students to the strategies, technologies, and techniques associated with this growing MIS specialty area.  Students learn what is involved in planning, designing, building, using, and managing a data warehouse.  Students also learn about how a data warehouse must fit into an over-all corporate data architecture that may include legacy systems, operational data stores, enterprise data warehouses, and data marts.  In addition, students are exposed to the different data mining techniques used by organizations to derive information from the data warehouse for strategic and long-term business decision making.

%X This article describes the content and delivery of a course on E-commerce strategy to senior computer information systems (CIS) majors in the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University. The course is designed to provide technically oriented CIS students with an appreciation for the organizational and strategic issues facing managers in a digital world.  To that end, we emphasize the strategic rather than the technical concerns of electronic commerce.   We find that both students and employers react favorably to the course content. Students are pleased with the positive reaction of employers to their knowledge of strategic issues. Employers remark that the course content mirrors real-world concerns and underscores the importance of analytical skills.  As we complete the third iteration of the course, we attribute our success to three factors. First, we demonstrate the role of strategy and decision-making in E-commerce from the beginning of the course. Second, we illustrate that companies within the same industry make very different strategic decisions with respect to E-commerce, and that these decisions often lead to very different outcomes. Third, we keep the content current by using a combination of existing cases and current events to illustrate key concepts.

%X This article began as a response to an exchange of letters concerning the need for more vs. less user participation in IS projects. It grew into an exploration of whether and how ten 1999 CAIS articles use basic IS/IT terms with different meanings and connotations related to the different perspectives of their authors. The article characterizes differences between an IT perspective and a business perspective and categorizes the ten articles accordingly. It then presents numerous quotes from the articles to illustrate differences across the articles in terms of their use of eight basic concepts: system, user, stakeholder, IS project, implementation, reengineering, requirements, and solution. To help understand the differences and their significance, the article makes extensive use of distinctions between work systems, information systems, and projects. When applied to the articles these distinctions raise questions such as whether the term "system" refers to a work system, information system, or software, and whether the term "user" refers to hands-on users, people who receive information, or managers whose organizations use information systems.  An underlying theme throughout is that the lack of conscious attention to the meaning of basic terms and points of reference may be a significant impediment to effective communication and to our ability to make sense out of research findings and even journalistic anecdotes about what seemed to work or not work in particular situations.

%X For many academics within the information systems discipline, the merits of the current processes we use to review papers to evaluate whether they should be published in journals is a contentious issue.  Allegations are often made that reviews are not timely, that their quality is low, that they are not supportive and affirming of authors, and that they reflect the prejudices of an "elite" who control the journals.  Whether we believe these allegations have substance will depend on our own experiences with journals and our knowledge of the experiences of colleagues.  Based on my own experiences, I believe the allegations have some foundation.  Accordingly, in this paper I present a manifesto for changing and hopefully improving the journal review process.  My manifesto has four major recommendations:  (1) remove the blind review process and make the names of authors, reviewers, and associate editors public;  (2) indicate the names of reviewers and editors on the published paper, along with their final recommendations, and the number of review cycles that the paper has undergone; (3) maintain a public Web archive of papers under review to enable colleagues other than the reviewers to comment on papers; (4) maintain a public Web archive of rejected papers along with the reviewers' and editors' reports. My goals are to make the review process more transparent, to make stakeholders more accountable for their actions, to mitigate the effect of biases and prejudices, to make the review process more affirming and supportive, and to reduce the likelihood of high-quality papers being wrongly rejected and low-quality papers being accepted.

%X In the e-commerce environment, individuals’ concerns for online information privacy play critical roles in determining their intention to use the Internet to provide personal information for services and transactions. Understanding this relationship has important implications for e-commerce. Despite much research in this area, an overarching picture of the relationship between information privacy concerns and the antecedent and consequence factors is yet to be drawn. Based on a review on empirical studies in this area, this research summarizes the conceptualizations of privacy concerns and the antecedents and consequences. An integrative framework is developed to illustrate the relationships between the factors. In this framework, a person’s concern for information privacy regarding a specific e-commerce website is distinguished from his/her concern for information privacy regarding the general e-commerce environment. These two forms of privacy concerns have distinct impacts on a person’s online behavior. Their relationships with multiple antecedent and consequence factors are analyzed.

%X Media Technology (MT) is a new, multidisciplinary field that integrates the knowledge, expertise, resources, and creativity of diverse, established, fertile artistic disciplines (visual design, art, music, radio, television) with new technological disciplines (digital media, information systems, information technology, computer science, network engineering) through rapidly-evolving technologies. Its application in electronic commerce into what will become a full synthesis of information technology and sensory interaction will be made possible by approaches to presenting and exchanging information visually, aurally--and eventually in combination with all of the senses. This article reports on a panel held at AMCIS 2002 in Dallas TX. The panel discussed the need to develop a literacy and understanding in the IT discipline of the MT and its importance in keeping IT research relevant. The panel also discussed strategies for attaining MT literacy, integrating MT into the IT curriculum, and discussed two universities where it is being done.

%X While the Internet has changed the world with online knowledge, communication, and collaboration, it has also introduced online addiction. Online game addiction can be severe with tragic outcomes. Most governments and organizations are yet to recognize the severity of online game addiction and the need for intervention. We briefly review the literature on online game addiction. We also summarize the limited attempts of governments to develop regulations aimed at preventing online game addiction. Special attention is paid to China and its efforts to reduce the number of hours that young people can play online. We present evidence suggesting that online game addiction is an issue that should be considered by governments everywhere and that information systems researchers can play an important role in analyzing the impacts of government regulation of online addiction and shaping regulation improvements.

%X A curriculum for a university-level course called Business Process Modeling is presented in order to provide guidance for the increasing number of institutions who are currently developing such contents. The course caters to undergraduate and post graduate students. Its content is drawn from recent research, industry practice, and established teaching material, and teaches ways of specifying business processes for the analysis and design of process-aware information systems. The teaching approach is a blend of lectures and classroom exercises with innovative case studies, as well as reviews of research material. Students are asked to conceptualize, analyze, and articulate real life process scenarios. Tutorials and cheat sheets assist with the learning experience. Course evaluations from 40 students suggest the adequacy of the teaching approach. Specifically, evaluations show a high degree of satisfaction with course relevance, content presentation, and teaching approach.

%X During the past years, increasingly more project managers started to recognize that human factors, in particular those related to project team success, are critical for overall project success. Hence, the scientific investigation of this topic has gained momentum. However, a review of the Information Systems and Information Technology (IST) literature on the determinants of project team success reveals that there has been limited research on this topic. Bearing this research gap in mind, it is reasonable to argue that IST theorizing can substantially benefit from new insights from other scientific disciplines in which studies on team effectiveness and project team success are already available. Therefore, the present article reviews and integrates the literature published in other disciplines in order to develop a conceptual model, which provides insights into the determinants of IST project team success. Moreover, a first empirical assessment based on interview data collected from sixteen project experts shows the utility of the model. Consequently, the contribution of the present article is twofold: First, we present a conceptual model applicable to IST project teams. Second, the theoretical insights addressed are useful for project managers who are responsible for project success. Propositions that guide future research are provided, and implications of the model for both theory and practice are discussed.

%X Process models are used by information professionals to convey semantics about the business operations in a real-world domain intended to be supported by an information system. The understandability of these models is vital to them being used for Information Systems development. In this article, we examine two factors that we predict will influence the understanding of a business process that novice developers obtain from a corresponding process model: the content presentation form chosen to articulate the business domain, and the user characteristics of the novice developers working with the model. Our experimental study provides evidence that novice developers obtain similar levels of understanding when confronted with an unfamiliar or a familiar process model. However, previous modeling experience, the use of English as a second language, and previous work experience in BPM are important influencing factors of model understanding. Our findings suggest that education and research in process modeling should increase the focus on human factors and how they relate to content and content presentation formats for different modeling tasks. We discuss implications for practice and research.

%X Editors have made requests of manuscript authors to carefully examine their reference lists and to incorporate references from the target journal.  These requests seem to have become more common, as is evidenced by this and other commentaries on the issue.  Journal self-citation requests may be viewed as impinging on an author’s academic freedom and could be construed as an unethical or unprofessional request.  In this commentary we argue that it is not necessarily the case that all, or even many, of these requests cross the line into unprofessional or unethical behavior.  There are a number of institutional and stakeholder forces that play a role in this seemingly simple editorial request.  These forces arise because of the environment that is faced by editors, authors, publishers, and their audiences.  We incorporate some discussion on these various motivating forces and the responses to them.  Rather than rushing to alter our codes of ethical editorial conduct, we need to take a careful look at our research and publication environment to determine the reason editors would make journal self-citation requests.

%X Since its inception in the early 1990s, the World Wide Web (Web) has grown enormously.  According to the “official Google blog” (Google 2008), the Web had 1 trillion (as in 1,000,000,000,000) unique coexisting URL’s as of July 25, 2008.   Given the exponential growth of the Web over time, an issue that is likely to gain prominence is that of outdated information.  This is especially important to study since many of us rely on the Web to find facts in order to take decisions.   For example, for students and researchers, the “date” of a document is important for scholarship and student work.  However, getting an accurate date on content is challenging, and furthermore, outdated pages that are not deleted from Web servers will continue to be returned in response to Web searches. The panel, held at the 2008 Americas Conference on Information Systems in Toronto, Canada, identified a number of research issues and opportunities that arise as a result of this phenomenon.

%X Consumers’ use of mobile data applications is expected to rise significantly in the next few years. While user acceptance and adoption of mobile applications have received growing interest from IS researchers, only a paucity of studies have focused on user continuance behaviors in the mobile commerce context. Studying the IS continuance behavior of 147 registered users of an information-oriented mobile application, this research extends the general model of IS continuance to include a number of explanatory antecedents: information quality, system quality, process quality, and hedonic value. The enhanced framework makes a significant contribution to the theory of IS continuance intention, and at the same time, it offers implications to mobile service providers for creating high quality mobile applications for consumers.

%X Empathy plays a central role in human behavior and is a key aspect of social functioning. The extensive research on the empathy construct in fields such as psychology, social work, and education has revealed many positive aspects of empathy. Through the use of cluster analysis, this research takes a new approach to reviewing the literature on empathy and objectively identifies groups of empathy research. Next, this study relates the information systems (IS) discipline’s focus on empathy research through the projection of IS empathy paragraphs into those clusters, and identifies areas of empathy research that are currently being largely overlooked by the IS field. The use of cluster analysis and projection for conducting a literature review provides researchers with a more objective approach for reviewing relevant literature.

%X Physicians face an increasing variety of options for using information systems in the course of delivering and managing medical care. Although the technical capabilities of medical information systems are expanding rapidly, such systems cannot be expected to be truly effective unless they mesh with the broader work system that includes the physician's work place and work routines. This research focuses on physicians' intent for continued use of an online medical evaluation system as an indicator of the mesh between an information technology and medical work environments, and it draws contextual elements from technology acceptance and compatibility models to help explain the intent for continued use. Ninety-seven physicians throughout the U.S. participated in an extensive survey that provided a basis for analysis, and results showed general support for the acceptance model used in the study. The theoretical and managerial implications of the study center on the importance of understanding continued use of medical information systems with the help of work practice compatibility and acceptance models as they apply to the demanding environment of medical practice.

%X This paper presents Persuasive Health Information systems (PHIs), which has been deployed over a period of eight months at a pilot site to improve health information dissemination among rural women in India. The design process of the PHI integrates social cues from the persuasive technology and the theory of planned behaviour for shaping social beliefs and health practices of rural women. Two field studies were conducted to design and evaluate the PHIs. The results from study one revealed social beliefs and practices related to primary health that formulated the design requirements for the PHIs. On the basis of these requirements, the social beliefs were addressed by applying persuasive social cues to the design of the form, content, and interaction of the PHIs. The results from study two involved comparative engagement between PHIs and an existing health information system supported by a local nongovernmental organization. The results indicate that application of persuasive technology can persuade the rural women to change their existing social beliefs and health practices in a positive manner. This paper contributes by providing theoretical understanding of what restricts the information transfer among rural women in terms of health care practices and how it can be addressed by applying persuasive technology for the design of health information systems. We hope that health practitioners, ICT developers and the design community would benefit from this approach in developing information systems for health care, e-government, and education in a rural context.

%X Information Systems (IS) research is undertaken to advance the body of knowledge on IS-related phenomena at the individual, group, and organizational levels of analysis. The goals of conducting IS research range from individual learning—e.g., the intellectual development of individual scholars over community learning; e.g., the enhancement of research in the broader IS academic community to the improvement of practice in organizations. Whereas IS research has been criticized for having limited practical relevance, many scholars have assumed that IS research is succeeding in having a major impact on the IS academic community itself. This article challenges the assumption. Using citations as a proxy for contributions to subsequent research—or research importance—this study presents average citation figures for 1,992 papers published in six peer-reviewed IS journals between 1996 and 2010. It finds that citation figures are strongly skewed, with a vast majority of works published in top IS outlets being cited rather rarely. The article offers a discussion of the factors that may account for this finding and closes with a brief summary and outlook.

%X In the past few years, design science has  become a topic of increasing importance, especially in the North American academic IS community. Some observers see a new hegemony forming. Others dispute that but suggest that design science is merely the latest bandwagon rolling through the IS domain. A panel at the 2008 International Conference on Information Systems debated views of design science prevalent in the IS community. This paper reports on the panel discussion and attempts to position design science from various perspectives, including North American and European views, the latter with a long tradition of design-based IS scholarship.

%X This research examines asynchronous participatory examinations, a new technology-mediated assessment strategy especially suitable for online courses. The participatory exam innovation utilizes information technology to support engaging students in the entire examination lifecycle, including creating and solving problems, and grading solutions. These learning processes enable students to not only gain new knowledge but also to strengthen their assessment skills. A five-semester field study in the U.S., supplemented by a small scale replication in Austria, investigated how participatory exams can facilitate higher-order learning and what explains students’ acceptance of the innovation. An extended version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), adapted to the educational context, predicts acceptance based on three key constructs: “perceived enjoyment,” “perceived learning,” and “recommendation for use.” The study results support the premises that participants perceive learning from all stages of the cooperative exam process, and that the innovation acceptance is a function of both intrinsic motivations (e.g., enjoyment of the experience) and extrinsic motivations (e.g., perception that one has learned from the process).

%X The consumerization of information technology (IT) refers to consumer IT resources, such as laptops, smartphones, social media, or cloud storage, that are used for business purposes. The topic has engendered an ongoing debate among practitioners. However, a scientific approach has yet to be developed to understand the effects of IT consumerization on individual performance in the workplace. In this paper, we conduct an inductive empirical study on pilot projects in an industrial and a public sector organization. From these data, we derive key concepts and develop a theoretical framework that conceptualizes the relationship between IT consumerization and job performance. In particular, ownership and freedom of choice are interesting concepts to provide insights beyond what has already been investigated in previous research on IT-related job performance. Our findings lay the foundation for developing a substantive theory that is independent of our area of enquiry. Moreover, they show numerous connections to the body of information systems literature that sharpen our construct definitions and raise the theoretical level of the results. We outline potential avenues for future research on IT consumerization based on our study’s contributions.

%X We report on the design and implementation of an unusual course in Information Systems (IS) management built around an extended case series: a fictitious but reality-based story about the trials and tribulations of a newly appointed but not-technically-trained Chief Information Officer (CIO) in his first year on the job. Together the cases constitute a true-to-life “novel” about IS management (published, in fact, as a novel, as well as individual cases). Four principles guided development of the series and its associated pedagogy: 1) Emphasis on integrative, soft-skill, and business-oriented aspects of IS, independent of underlying technologies; 2) Student derivation and ongoing refinement of cumulative theoretical frameworks arrived at via in-class discussion; 3) Identification of a set of core issues vital to practice that collectively approximate IS management as a business discipline; and 4) Design for student engagement, in particular by basing the case “story” on the monomyth, a literary pattern common to important narratives around the world. A supporting website facilitates sharing of teaching materials and experiences by faculty using the case series. We report results from using this curriculum with undergraduate and graduate students in two universities in different countries, and with executives at a multinational corporation and in an executive program at Harvard Business School. Our results suggest that a “novel-based” approach holds considerable promise for use at undergraduate, graduate, and executive levels, and that it might have advantages in addressing the so-called “enrollment crisis” in IS education, especially with the generation of “digital natives” who have come of age in an environment crowded with engaging approaches to communication and entertainment that compete for their attention.

%X Little attention has been given in the development of a systematic approach for elaborating and using enterprise knowledge to manage organisational change. In this paper we present a framework based on the confluence of two technologies: enterprise knowledge modelling and process guidance. The framework comprises of a set of modelling components for describing intentional enterprise knowledge, and a number of strategies for reasoning with enterprise knowledge during organisational change projects. Dynamic selection of appropriate strategies is guided by the use of a methodology roadmap. The approach is demonstrated using examples from an industrial application of change resulting from de-regulation in the electricity supply sector.

%X The advent of the Internet and the subsequent adoption of Open Access schemata are changing the nature of the scholarly discourse. In response, we seek to stimulate a debate about the role and desired forms of Open Access publishing in the context of the Information System (IS) discipline. We explore the potential contribution of an Open Access perspective on publishing IS-related research and also discuss the roles of traditional journals and their prospects in the contexts of our observations. In particular, we focus on the new possibilities of publishing work-in-progress and its potential benefit for knowledge dissemination including the prospects of turning today's limited scholarly exchange into mass collaboration. We illustrate our vision with a working prototype of an Open Access disciplinary repository entitled Sprouts (http://sprouts.aisnet.org). Our  aim is to inspire new thinking about the role of Open Access publishing, the potential of its application to disciplinary repositories of emergent work, its anticipated repercussions on our work practices, and its long-term implication for the impact of IS scholarship and the well-being of our community at large. We call for participation and further action in realizing a global repository of IS research in progress. This paper builds on a panel on Open Access that was presented at the 2008 International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS), held in Paris, France, in December 2008.

%X Agile methods and traditional structured approaches are often viewed as competing bi-polar choices. Agile methods such as Scrum and XP are recommended for small, co-located projects that involve changing requirements. The traditional structured plan-driven approaches, such as the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and the waterfall lifecycle frameworks, are recommended for large projects with stable requirements. If a project is large, strategically important, distributed, and has dynamic user requirements and organizational changes, it presents unique challenges that neither the agile methods nor the traditional structured approaches can effectively deal with alone. Although there is an increasing call for a balanced approach, there is little empirical research that shows when and how the two approaches can complement each other. Based on a case study from the cruise line industry of a large distributed strategic project with unanticipated changes, we conclude that this balance is not only workable, but is essential to ensure that the project demonstrates both control and agility for achieving its challenging and dynamic goals. Agile without structure can cause chaos, particularly in large complex distributed projects where planning, control, and coordination are critical. Structure without agility can lead to rigidity, particularly when a project involves a great deal of learning, discovery, and changes.

%X This paper responds to the question of whether it is ethical for a journal editor to request an author to cite papers from a journal to which one is submitting an article. To craft a response to this question, two sets of relationships are explored. The first set is an author-reader relationship, and the second set is an author-institution or community relationship. In these dual relationships, the author is considered to be an IS researcher who publishes and disseminates knowledge through the channel of research journals. The reason for articulating these twofold relationships is to go beyond the common belief that the author is the sole and autonomous source of knowledge creation and distribution. We posit that: (1) an author cannot exist isolated from the reader, and (2) an author exists only as a part of an institutional system which opens and at the same time constrains an author’s knowledge production. In other words, an author is destined to create knowledge within the constrained system. For that very reason, it is important to understand the author as a function of conditional discourse of a specific institution. We conclude that editors’ requests for an author to cite papers from a journal to which one is submitting an article is ethically critical to: (1) build a good author-reader relationship, and (2) produce rich and plural knowledge which is “good” for advancing learning in the global community.

%X There is a general consensus about the lack of usability in most open source software (OSS). Academics and practitioners have offered several suggestions to improve the usability of such software. However, a realistic assessment of OSS projects, specifically the motivations of OSS developers and their attitude toward software usability, lack of user feedback, and absence of usability experts in OSS projects, leads to the conclusion that strategies to improve OSS usability are unlikely to succeed anytime soon. The only exceptions will be OSS which enjoy sufficient financial support from individuals and organizations, and software that were developed by commercial software producers and later released under an open source license.

%X This paper is the summary of a panel presentation at the Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS) 2008.  We examine methods to employ in managing student projects.  With the underlying assumption that we all want students to learn from their projects and become successful in the workplace while minimizing our micromanaging as instructors, we will share what we have learned from our (and our students’) successes and failures.  Another assumption is that if you have taught classes in which you have used student group projects, you are not 100 percent pleased with the results and would not do everything the exact same way again.  In our discussion, we examine successful methods for managing the aspects of forming groups, managing teams, and the project assignment itself including guidelines, deliverables, evaluation, and presentation.

%X This article presents a review of the research on Building Information Modeling (BIM) in construction, with the aim of identifying areas in this domain where IS research can contribute. The concept of BIM comprises an infrastructure of IT tools supporting collaborative and integrated design, assembly, and operation of buildings. This integrated construction approach, with all stakeholders editing or retrieving information from commonly shared models, requires major changes to well-established processes, organizational roles, contractual practices, and collaborative arrangements in the construction industry. Through a review of 264 research articles on BIM, we found that this research spans a wide area of technological and organizational topics, of which many have a clear resonance to focal areas in IS research. Our analysis shows that IS, to some extent, serves as a reference discipline and that theories used in IS research are also informing contemporary BIM research. The following areas in need of further IS research were identified: studies on the relationship between BIM’s functional affordance and human agency, adoption and use of BIM for inter-organizational collaboration, the influence of organizational culture on BIM practices, the capabilities of BIM for transforming industry practice, and identifying the business value of BIM. Considering that a well-established knowledge base in IS research can be drawn upon for studying these issues, combined with the exciting potential of BIM for transforming a major industry such as building construction, we conclude that BIM is an area ripe for IS research.

%X The unprecedented success of social networking sites (SNSs) has been recently overshadowed by concerns about privacy risks. As SNS users grow weary of privacy breaches and thus develop distrust, they may restrict or even terminate their platform activities. In the long run, these developments endanger SNS platforms’ financial viability and undermine their ability to create individual and social value. By applying a justice perspective, this study aims to understand the means at the disposal of SNS providers to leverage the privacy concerns and trusting beliefs of their users—two important determinants of user participation on SNSs. Considering that SNSs have a global appeal, empirical tests assess the effectiveness of justice measures for three culturally distinct countries: Germany, Russia and Morocco. The results indicate that these measures are particularly suited to address trusting beliefs of SNS audience. Specifically, in all examined countries, procedural justice and the awareness dimension of informational justice improve perceptions of trust in the SNS provider. Privacy concerns, however, are not as easy to manage, because the impact of justice-based measures on privacy concerns is not universal. Beyond theoretical value, this research offers valuable practical insights into the use of justice-based measures to promote trust and mitigate privacy concerns in a cross-cultural setting.

%X Building on previous research, we demonstrate how a punctuated process model can describe and analyze a specific information system development project. In this paper, we focus on an Information Systems (IS) project that was being implemented in a UK retail Small-Medium sized Enterprise (SME) where a new system was being implemented to replace the existing, failing one. Generally, the combination of these IS research models can provide us with a new, practical and valuable way in understanding Information Systems Development (ISD) as a social process. There were several contributions using our punctuated process model. We show how social-technical equilibriums were perturbed by the critical incidents that occurred externally to the project. Furthermore, the ability of the project team in dealing with unexpected events was seen as vital skill in ensuring the stability of a project. In contrast, allowing the project to drift was shown to lead to a degree of chaos. Third, patterns from past project or similar patterns from other system processes, as have been suggested the literature, have significant impacts on current project patterns. However, in practice, we found that the knowledge generated from past project patterns or similar patterns from other systems may be of only limited use: actors in our ISD drama were often reactive, not anticipatory. Despite the limitations and complexity associated with this type of research, our approach demonstrates the possibility of employing the punctuated process model in the study of ISD in a variety of organizations as a descriptive and diagnostic tool. The paper ends with suggestions for scholars in IS research as well as practitioners involved in IS projects.

%X Information systems provide both the means for organizations to transact business and the ability to report the financial results of their operations. Information technology auditing is an integral part of corporate governance. However, information technology auditing  is often looked upon as a “necessary evil” or is  overlooked entirely by IT management  We argue that IT audit activities can provide additional value beyond the primary objective of assurance, assuming the organization embraces IT governance partnerships between IT management and the audit function.  We also analyze factors developed from field study research that suggest IT audits are special projects requiring a quality audit process and sound project management principles. These success factors, if managed properly, can lead to high-quality IT audit products (i.e., engagements) that could conceivably free audit resources for more value-added projects and enterprise oversight.  We close with a discussion of future research directions.

%X This article presents the work system life cycle (WSLC) model, according to which a work system, an information system, or a software product passes through one or more iterations of four phases: initiation, development, implementation, and operation and maintenance. Although this descriptive model is both clear enough to understand readily and specific enough to apply easily, it encompasses a variety of other models commonly used to describe information system life cycles, organizational change processes, projects, and the life cycles of software products. The explicit inclusion of both an operation and maintenance phase and iterations allows it to cover both continuous and discontinuous change. This article explains the need for this type of model and shows how it spans more than a dozen descriptive and normative models that appear in the IS literature.  The WSLC model could help bridge the communication gap between business and IT professionals, could help both do their own system-related work, and could help students grasp the broad alternatives for building and modifying systems.  Comparison of the WSLC phases with the phases of other models shows that many of those models might be misleading to people who are not primed to understand why their goals and assumptions are quite different. Both software-focused and process-focused models in the IS literature tend to emphasize development activities and de-emphasize implementation in the organization and ongoing operation and maintenance. Instead of providing clarity, use of some of these models in practice and teaching might reinforce common misunderstandings and naive expectations that stereotype information system projects as either IT projects performed by technologists or as organizational change projects in which technology plays only a secondary role. The WSLC model encourages a balanced view that includes both the organizational and technological viewpoints without minimizing either.

%X Issues involving method effects are routinely taught to PhD students in Information Systems (IS).  Unfortunately, the results of an assessment of a population of 128 survey-based studies published in three top IS journals over a six-year period (1999-2005) reveal that relatively little attention is being paid to method bias and that the threat of serious method bias is great in many of the published studies.  For instance, even the best-understood variety of method bias--common source bias--is found to have gone unnoted in over one-third of the papers that used a single respondent for all construct measures for reasons other than necessity.  This study was motivated by studies in other areas of the social sciences which have resulted in calls for areas such as IS to conduct empirical assessments of the frequency of the various forms of method bias.  Here, the myriad sources of method bias are reviewed and methods for minimizing or eliminating method effects, both in the design of a study and in the subsequent analysis of the data, are discussed.  Data on the frequency of appearance of a wide variety of potential sources of method bias are provided and conclusions are drawn.  A series of recommendations is made concerning creating greater awareness of method bias on the part of the IS research community and greater use of method bias criteria in the screening reviews of papers that are done by IS journals.

%X The practice of editorial “self-referencing” – journal editors requiring that authors include in their papers a specific number of citations from the journal in which they seek to publish – has recently garnered significant interest within the IS academic community.  A recent survey of AISWorld suggests that the vast majority of respondents find this practice inappropriate and unethical. Rather than dismissing this behavior as patently unethical, this paper seeks to better understand the possible motivations for this editorial behavior.  The notion of the ethical dilemma is introduced, as well as a framework to assist in analyzing them.  Ultimately, the analysis suggests that while editors may feel they have worthwhile reasons for requiring self-references, the potential long term risks to the journal, the academy, and the body of knowledge outweigh those reasons.

Globalization has further accentuated banks’ reliance on IT, leading to further increase in their IT investment.  It is not all that clear, however, whether these investments pay off. This case brings to the fore the complexities involved in measuring IT investment by comparing and contrasting the IT strategies of two of the world’s largest banks: HSBC and Citigroup. Will the IT investment strategies adopted by HSBC and Citigroup enhance their operational efficiency or strategic positions? Facing financial turmoil, HSBC and Citigroup adopted different IT strategies. Which of them is more appropriate? Which of the two banks will have higher returns on their IT investments in the long run? How should they measure such returns?

%X This article uses the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model (UTAUT) as the basis for the research framework to examine factors that influence student-perceived learning outcomes and satisfaction in enterprise resource planning (ERP) courses. Antecedent variables considered are student attitude, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, training (hands-on), course structure, and perceived instructor knowledge. A Structural Equation Model (SEM) using LISREL was employed to test the measurement and structural models using a convenience sample of 102 students enrolled in ERP courses. The results showed that student attitude had the largest significant direct impact on student-perceived learning outcomes and satisfaction. Effort expectancy and performance expectancy had significant direct impacts on attitude. Course structure and training (hands-on) had indirect effects on attitude through effort expectancy and performance expectancy. The findings suggest that, in order to impact student attitude and, thus, impact their perceived learning outcomes and satisfaction, instructors should emphasize the importance of learning about ERP systems and should provide clear directions so that students experience a meaningful interaction with ERP systems. Implications for practitioners and educators are reported.

%X Enterprise architecture (EA) is the definition and representation of a high-level view of an enterprise’s business processes and IT systems, their interrelationships, and the extent to which these processes and systems are shared by different parts of the enterprise. EA aims to define a suitable operating platform to support an organisation’s future goals and the roadmap for moving towards this vision. Despite significant practitioner interest in the domain, understanding the value of EA remains a challenge. Although many studies make EA benefit claims, the explanations of why and how EA leads to these benefits are fragmented, incomplete, and not grounded in theory. This article aims to address this knowledge gap by focusing on the question: How does EA lead to organisational benefits? Through a careful review of EA literature, the paper consolidates the fragmented knowledge on EA benefits and presents the EA Benefits Model (EABM). The EABM proposes that EA leads to organisational benefits through its impact on four benefit enablers: Organisational Alignment, Information Availability, Resource Portfolio Optimisation, and Resource Complementarity. The article concludes with a discussion of a number of potential avenues for future research, which could build on the findings of this study.

%X This article shares best practices for increasing IS (information systems) enrollment based on the experiences of five people who have led their department’s enrollment efforts over the past 3.5 years. Prior to launching these enrollment initiatives, each university’s IS enrollment had reached record-breaking lows, mirroring enrollments nationwide. At the writing of this article, each university has both increased its IS enrollment and improved its program quality. These journeys have resulted in five best practices: make IS enrollment a long-term priority, partner with external stakeholders (i.e., employers, students, and other programs), incentivize students, maintain curriculum rigor, and add value. This article will help IS programs surmount the current challenges and attract, retain, and place IS majors.

%X While many business schools developed programs or courses on e-commerce, there is a need for a course that truly focuses on the technology.  Specifically, the course should address the knowledge of tools, techniques, and developmental methodology of e-commerce systems.  In this paper, we address the developmental methodology for an e-commerce technology course.  We focus on the development of an infrastructure and management of an e-commerce application development environment.  We also discuss a systems development methodology that addresses both the business and technology aspects of e-commerce.

Throughout its history, its design and administration has experienced significant dynamic changes as the Internet itself has evolved. The history of the DNS is divided into six eras, based on underlying technological and administrative themes within each era. Developments in its governance, its application, and in other factors are discussed. Future directions for DNS use and abuse are explored, along with challenges in its future governance. Finally, a proposed research model is included to guide future study of the DNS evolution and its influences from political, legal, psychological, sociological, and technological perspectives.

%X Accrediting agencies in the United States require business schools to conduct ongoing assessment directed at continuous improvement of their instruction. Because direct assessment efforts are usually more time consuming and resource-intensive than indirect assessment, it would be helpful if indirect assessment could be used as an effective alternative, at least on occasion. The validity of one indirect method, student self-assessment, has been debated in the research literature. This study compares results of direct measures and student self-assessments for learning outcomes in an Information Systems course. We find student self-assessments are valid proxies for direct assessment when used with some types of learning outcomes but not others. We discuss possible reasons for the difference and the implications for assessment in Information System programs.

%X As organizations extend the online delivery of services and data across departmental, organizational, and even jurisdictional boundaries, they must trust that they can identify and authenticate the customers, businesses, employees, and third parties using them. Traditional approaches to identity management (IDM), such as documents, clearly don’t work in the online world, yet to date there is no online equivalent of the passport or photo-id. Instead, organizations have established their own identity management practices. As a result, IT managers are looking for more holistic and standardized IDM practices that could simplify access to multiple services and enable organizations to collaborate and cooperate across global organizational boundaries, as well as keep identity information secure and private. This article explores these IDM challenges and how managers are approaching this issue. It discusses the key management components of IDM looking first at the basic concepts of IDM, its essential elements, and organizational stakeholders. Next, it examines why IDM is increasingly a business concern, in addition to an IT concern and describes the key IDM challenges facing IT managers. It then distils key principles of effective IDM and makes recommendations for how IT managers can improve on their current IDM efforts.

%X A recent and controversial issue in the academic publishing process is “forced journal self-citations”—i.e., the requirement that the author(s) include a minimum number of references to a journal as a condition of publication.  This paper uses stakeholder theory to model the positions of both authors and journal representatives.  We also used two empirical surveys to answer the questions (1) how ethical are such requests, and (2) how common are they?  Our initial, stakeholder analysis suggests that neither an author nor the IS profession at large is likely to consider such requests ethical.  Our empirical surveys suggest that, although about one-third of the respondents had encountered such requests, most agreed that such requests are unethical.

%X The role of information systems in influencing and enabling organisational design is widely acknowledged. Yet limited attention is paid to the theoretical legitimacy and conceptual basis of IS-enabled organisational change i.e., business engineering. In this paper we review business engineering's reference disciplines critically: process-based organisational design, IS development, and IS evaluation. Findings from a case study of business engineering provide empirical support to the theoretical analysis. Synthesis of the conclusions of the review and the case study lead to a number of propositions and potential avenues for further research into the theoretically attractive and practically important field of aligning the design of organisational structures with the design of Information Systems intended to support them.

%X Early investigation of the acceptance of new information technology applications will help to improve the chances of later success. In incipient stages of product deployment, before people develop a full understanding of the aspects of a new technology, users may display particular reasons for or against its use. Accordingly, this study proposes and tests empirically, through structural equation modeling techniques, a perceived risk-motivation model for the early study of new information technology acceptance. The research framework is a Web scenario describing the possible use of wireless text messaging on cell phones to improve user adherence to healthy behavior. While the underlying personal motivation may favor adoption, perceived risks may be an obstacle. This study integrates a multi-faceted perceived risk concept with a motivational model in an unbiased measure of the initial development phase of new information technology, to estimate its acceptance.

%X Companies spend anywhere from 1 percent to 10 percent of their gross revenues on information technology; some financial services companies actually spend much more.  For a company with revenue in the $5 billion range, this could mean an annual technology expenditure of $500 million.  Do boards of directors “govern” technology investments?  Are they involved in major technology decisions?  What role should they have in the acquisition, deployment and support of technology?  The analysis reported in this document is based on a survey and follow-up interviews to more than 50 senior business technology executives.  The findings reported benchmark the state of the practice—and suggest how companies can improve business technology governance.
%X The prescriptive literature suggests that it is time for boards to assume meaningful oversight of technology investments and strategies.  The data we collected (and the interviews that we conducted) support the descriptive literature:  there is relatively little board involvement in technology planning or oversight.  The overall conclusion is that boards of directors do not participate nearly enough in major technology decisions, are surprisingly out of the technology loop on technology issues, and are therefore missing opportunities to optimize operational and strategic technology investments.  The paper ends with recommendations about the role that boards of directors should play in technology decision-making.

%X A credibility crisis continues to plague the information systems (IS) discipline. For decades IS has struggled to acquire and maintain its stature as a highly-respected academic discipline. The recent demise of several IS programs around the world highlights the credibility crisis, as departments have been subsumed into other business disciplines, or worse yet, abandoned entirely. In a recent MIS Quarterly article, Gill and Bhattacherjee [2009] highlight some of the challenges facing IS: low student enrollments, research that is rarely discussed in our classrooms, and research that fails to make an impact in practice. While useful tactics in terms of research [Dennis et al., 2006], student recruitment [Koch et al., 2010; Looney and Akbulut, 2007] and pedagogy [Firth et al., 2008] have surfaced, a holistic strategy for addressing the credibility crisis has yet to emerge. This article summarizes a panel discussion at the AMCIS 2010 conference, where a group of distinguished IS professors offered their unique perspectives on the challenges, origins, and solutions related to the current credibility crisis in IS.

%X The use of structural equation modeling (SEM) has grown dramatically in the field of management information systems (MIS) in the past twenty years, but SEM’s focus has been primarily on cross-sectional data sets. Functionally, SEM has been used to test measurement and path models, but the SEM approach has not been applied to repeated measures designs. In this article, we describe latent growth models (LGMs), an extension of SEM, which focuses on how observed and/or latent variables change over time. The purpose of this paper is to provide a primer on the use of LGMs, as well as to advocate for its use to extend MIS theory. We illustrate several flexible applications of LGMs using longitudinal data, including conditional, unconditional, and dual growth models. We discuss the advantages of using LGMs over other more traditional longitudinal approaches, and highlight areas in MIS where researchers can use this technique effectively.

%X The paper examines the risks, cost, size, implications, and likely outcomes of the Year 2000 or "Y2K" Problem, as well as the lessons learned, opportunities, and silver linings of Y2K projects.  The MIS academic community has largely missed a unique opportunity to be relevant to practitioners as well as our communities.  Fortunately, it is not too late since knowledgeable and rational voices are needed to help communities, and the people and enterprises in them, intelligently deal with the challenges of Y2K.  Strangely, in spite of billions of bytes of data about year 2000 problem appearing each week, we still know surprisingly little about the reality of the Y2K risks we face.  And there is little chance that a complete assessment of even the greatest risks faced by our enterprises and communities can be made, let alone repairs completed.  Then there are the global risks of Y2K, and the thorny fact that most Y2K risks are beyond our direct control anyway.  So what can ethical, conscientious, and concerned MIS professionals do about this situation?  How can we help our communities reduce risks, appropriately plan for contingencies, and quickly manage failures?  With only a few months to go, this may be the last chance we have to be relevant, enhance our collective credibility, and genuinely help improve IS practices.

%X The World Wide Web (WWW) has become a premier source for locating information. However, much of Web’s content has not been verified for accuracy, relevance, or completeness. Using the IS success model, the technology acceptance model, and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology models as a foundation, we empirically examined the impact of four constructs (perceived information quality, perceived design quality, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use) on task performance. We used Structural equation modeling to evaluate a new model for establishing a predictive relationship between the four constructs and task performance. Results indicate that there is a path relationship leading to accurate, relevant, and complete answers on the WWW. In the conclusion, we discuss the practical and theoretical implications of our research.

%X Businesses engaging in outsourcing of professional service activities to organizations in foreign countries have focused primarily on the issues of cost and the number of jobs affected. However, significant transfers of intangibles occur in many service-based offshoring arrangements as well. Some of these intangibles are considered to be intellectual property (IP). The transfer of intellectual property that accompanies such offshoring arrangements can have significant value, making it important to understand risks of loss, obligations of taxation, and contributions to the profit-making potential of an enterprise. Software is an important and often under-valued component of such transfers of intellectual property. This overview paper offers an interdisciplinary examination of intellectual property valuation issues and a business perspective for considering software valuation in the context of offshoring decisions and practices.

%X Time is an important factor in the use of information technology. However, traditional information systems research methods cannot adequately account for the dynamic nature of time-based relationships often found in longitudinal data. This shortcoming is problematic when investigating volatile relationships that evolve over time (e.g., information technology use across users, departments, and organizations). Educational, sociological, and management researchers study the influence of time using a rigorous multilevel method called growth modeling. We demonstrate the use of growth modeling in this tutorial, which is based on a semester-long study of an actual web-based university-level course content delivery system. The tutorial provides guidance on preliminary data tests, the construction and analysis of growth models using hierarchical linear modeling, and the interpretation of final results. The tutorial also describes other unique advantages of using growth modeling for IS research.

Step 1 involves transforming the variable into a percentile rank, which will result in uniformly distributed probabilities. The second step applies the inverse-normal transformation to the results of Step 1 to form a variable consisting of normally distributed z-scores. The approach is little-known outside the statistics literature, has been scarcely used in the social sciences, and has not been used in any IS study. The article illustrates how to implement the approach in Excel, SPSS, and SAS and explains implications and recommendations for IS research.

%X The MIS discipline faces the need to periodically re-establish its relevance to both academics and practitioners. Evolving technology forces our discipline to change at a rate far exceeding that of other business disciplines. In the workplace, rapidly evolving IT management issues and technologies have led corporations to manage technical employees differently than other employees. In academia, however, MIS faculty are faced with the same expectations as other business faculty. The current model of MIS as an academic discipline has many issues that make staying current and relevant very difficult. The result is that MIS research and teaching lag practice. One might argue that as the field matures, we are falling further behind. This paper is the outcome of a panel discussion held during the 2006 Americas Conference on Information Systems in Acapulco, Mexico. The panel discussed the assertions that MIS is on a "Slippery Slope" that threatens our existence as a business discipline and that our current model encourages irrelevance, both in research and in teaching. Panel members were asked to share their views on five questions relative to the Slippery Slope from their unique perspectives.

%X E-learning has considerable financial, social and organisational advantages. However, e-learning use among professional workplaces remains limited comparing to traditional methods. This raises the problem of factors influencing the adoption of e-learning among human resource management practices. This paper tries to identify and test determinants of e-learning use by workers. Technology adoption theories developed in information system researches offer a conceptual framework to apprehend key factors that influence workers' intention to use e-learning. Empirical study conducted on 350 Tunisian employees suggests the importance of their perceptions of usefulness, ease of use and computer self-efficacy judgments as key determinants of e-learning acceptance. Theoretical and Managerial implications for researchers and human resource managers are derived from the results of this research.

%X To explain the viral diffusion process, most of previous studies focus on the structure of social networks and the existence of the hub.  We extend the scope of analysis from a single node to a tie between the sender and the receiver to explain the impact of tie characteristics on the viral diffusion measured by its speed (i.e., how quickly) and by its volume (i.e., how much viral).  Based on our analysis results using a viral marketing data of 30,035 sender-receiver ties, we find that (1) the more heterogeneous the tie is, the quicker the response occurs; and (2) heavy viral generators tend to be connected to each other.   Taken together, this research  broadens the study of online viral diffusion by applying tie characteristics in terms of the volume and speed of the viral.

%X A Russian start-up company successfully introduced bottled still water to the Russian market and, despite the rapid growth of competition, three years later remained the market leader. The firm’s CFO convinces the CEO of the need for an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. He justifies the ERP as the means to enhance financial and administrative controls, to prepare for an IPO, and, among other reasons, to create efficiencies by better linking the St. Petersburg headquarters with their bottling facility located 100 miles to the north. The implementation fails, primarily due to widespread resistance within the factory as well as from the firm’s COO. The Case provides students with a rich look at implementation and counter-implementation of information systems as well as the high-level politics that can often seemingly mysteriously impact systems implementation. Further interest and opportunities for discussion are added via the Russian context and the transition to free markets, as well as the technical and operational work-arounds often required to deal with the inadequate public infrastructure often found in less developed parts of the world or, as in this case, in sections of a particular country.

As consumers demand more online services, physicians respond by adopting information technology into their daily routines.  In this paper, we first present recent developments within the telemedicine and e-health fields that necessitate the establishment of a consumer-to-healthcare provider (C2H) electronic marketplace.  Next, we discuss the services this marketplace should offer to both consumers and physicians for it to thrive in this extensively regulated industry.  Finally, we compare these services with those provided by what we call a "first-generation C2H marketplace," a comparison that clearly outlines practical implications for the C2H marketplaces of the future.

In this article, we report the results of a survey distributed to CEOs and CIOs at 1400 U.S. hospitals regarding their perceptions of the key information technology (IT) issues in healthcare. Among the top ten issues, the implementation of electronic medical records is ranked the highest. Included in the top ten are issues related to: improving healthcare quality by the use of information technology; change management, privacy, security, and accuracy of electronic records; and decision support applications. While some differences existed, we found much similarity between the views of the CEOs and the CIOs with both groups being characterized as conservative and risk-averse in their entrepreneurial orientation. No major differences were observed between urban and rural hospitals, or large and small hospitals. Given the heightened interest in healthcare IT, these results have wide implications for many stakeholders in this burgeoning industry.

%X Steganography is the art and science of hiding information. In the digital realm, steganography (which literally means “covered writing”), involves hiding data or messages in digital files and other digital structures. The carriers holding the hidden content may appear to be innocuous, and would be ignored by a casual observer. The field of digital information hiding has grown significantly since the 1990s. Evidence of this growth can be seen at workshops on information hiding and in occasional reports of use by criminals and terrorists as reported in the popular press. In contrast to cryptography where the message is encoded, the purpose of steganography is to hide the fact that a message is being sent. Once encoded, a cryptographically altered message typically appears unrecognizable and would raise suspicions. The primary advantage of steganography over cryptography is that the carriers do not attract attention to themselves, to messengers, or to recipients. Modern information technology enables novice computer users to create steganographic messages, transmit, and unhide them without special expertise. This article presents an overview of steganography’s history and the categories of steg methods, followed by a discussion of the application areas for steganography. We also present some technical details of the techniques and software for applying steganography, including some security-related attack issues. Our article concludes with a presentation of some key topics for the reader’s consideration.

After providing a brief historical overview of IS model curricula and describing the reasons why a revision is overdue, the paper focuses on three main aspects of the current revision proposal. These include: 1) extending the reach and applicability of the curriculum model beyond business schools and making it a genuinely global model; 2) separating core topics from career track electives and including career tracks in the model; and 3) revising the curriculum development model to be significantly more inclusive using modern Web-based technologies.

%X Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley (SOX) Act addresses the effectiveness of internal controls, which in most organizations are either fully or partially automated due to the pervasiveness and ubiquity of information technologies. Significant or material control deficiencies have to be reported publicly.  The adverse impact on organizations declaring deficiencies can be severe, for example, damage to reputation and/or market value. While there are many practitioner-led manuals and methods for dealing with 404, there has been little published in the academic research literature investigating the role of Information Systems organizations in implementing Section 404.  The paper addresses this gap in knowledge.  We used institutional theory as the lens through which to examine the experiences of Section 404 implementation in three global organizations.  We used the case study method and an abductive strategy to gather and analyze data respectively. Our findings are summarized in six recommendations.  We found that institutional pressures play a critical role in the implementation of Section 404.  In particular, organizations face coercive pressure to achieve Section 404 compliance, without which punitive sanctions can be imposed by regulators.  Organizations tend to imitate one another in the methods they use so that each is perceived to be in line with their competitive environment.  Organizations face normative pressures to act in ways that are socially acceptable, which is to achieve compliance.  Failure to do so would be a signal to the market that the organization does not take controls seriously.  We expand these findings in terms of power and influence tactics that IS organizations can use when implementing Section 404.  Our findings provide directions for practice and lines of enquiry for further research.

%X The complexities and costs of current information architectures, infrastructures, and distributed data and software have provided impetus to emerging conceptualizations of the Service Oriented Enterprise (SOE). The foundations for SOE can be found in current applications of service oriented architecture (SOA), service oriented infrastructure (SOI), business process and workflow, computing resource virtualization, business semantics, service level agreements, increasing standardization, and other areas of applied research. This article reports on a panel held at the 2006 Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS) in Acapulco, Mexico, regarding the impacts of SOE tenets on the IS field. Two organizations that are at the leading edge of the SOE continuum [American Express and Intel] in terms of vision and experiences were represented by Margaret Mitchell and George Brown. In addition, MIS academics were represented on the panel by the authors, researchers from Arizona State University. Both industry and academics brought unique perspectives. American Express' SOE approach addresses organizational structure and business intelligence project workflow issues. The company hosts one of the largest IT infrastructures capable of handling untold numbers of transactions each second. Intel's SOE approach addresses the orchestration of services and workflows in the cross-architecture environments characterizing the modern extended global enterprise. Intel is playing a lead role in establishing the OASIS (the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards) SOA Reference Model (called 'ebSOA').

%X Not long ago, IT-based risk was a fairly low-key activity focused on whether IT could deliver projects successfully and keep applications up and running. But with the opening up of the organization’s boundaries to external partners, service providers, external electronic communications, and online services, managing IT-based risk has morphed into a “bet the company” proposition. Not only is the scope of the job bigger, the stakes are much higher. As companies have become more dependent on IT for everything they do, the costs of service disruption and inadequate security practices have escalated exponentially. Therefore, the job of managing IT-based risk has become broader and more complex. Whereas in the past companies have sought security through physical or technological means (e.g., locked rooms, virus scanners), there is now growing understanding that managing IT-based risk must be a strategic and holistic activity that is not just the responsibility of a small group of IT specialists, but part of a mindset that extends from partners and suppliers to employees and customers. This paper explores how organizations are addressing and coping with increasing IT-based risk. It presents the results of an in-depth discussion of this issue with 20 senior IT practitioners and the challenges facing them. It proposes a holistic view of risk and examines the characteristics and components needed to develop an effective risk management framework, presenting a generic framework for integrating the growing number of elements involved in it. Finally, it describes successful practices organizations could use for improving their risk management capabilities.

%X Information systems (IS) research has a rich history of self-referential research efforts, i.e., those in which the object under study happens to be IS research itself. The nature of such inquiry has always been an ontological pursuit of the identity of IS research. In the current paper, we adopt a positivistic approach to what exactly is the identity of IS research. We extrapolate the IS discipline as an organization using concepts from organizational identity, and incorporate the quest for identity as a form of social identity, thus bringing it within the theoretical realm of the social identity theory. We posit that the best way to seek out this ontological pursuit is by looking at the observations of IS research from its highest level of abstraction–that is, from a metaresearch perspective. We examine the literature and identify major recurrent themes that discuss the identity of IS research–those that focus on the essence, the sustainability, indeed, the very future of IS research. We develop a framework based on this overarching quest for identity as a unifying theme that integrates the diverse streams as dimensions of achieving identity. These metaresearch streams include rigor, relevance, diversity and the essential core. We also look at current trends in IS research and highlight how they appear to correlate well with this research framework.

%X The relationship of user involvement to successful systems development has been the focus of much attention for information systems researchers for some time.  Common understanding has been that extensive user involvement is not only important, but absolutely essential to system success. However, earlier studies trying to link user involvement to system success have shown mixed results. In this paper we review 28 empirical research studies that investigate the significance of user involvement. From our results we conclude that user involvement in the systems development process is indeed important to system success. We further identify several key points pertinent to making user involvement effective.

%X Researchers studying the economics of information security have traditionally focused on the use of rational choice decision models for evaluating investment alternatives. Security investment decisions involve risk, and several researchers have noted that risk-related decisions often violate the fundamental principles of rational choice decision models. This study tests the prevailing presumption in published research that information security investment decisions are made in an entirely rational manner. We empirically validated our hypothesis that information security investment decision makers in fact exhibit preference reversals when faced with competing budget alternatives involving risk. Specifically, we observed the framing effect under prospect theory, which suggests that individuals exhibit unique risk attitudes when evaluating gain-related and loss-related risk decisions. Accordingly, we argue that existing, widely accepted rational choice and economic models for information security investments need to be supplemented with risk perception measurement and account for individual level decision biases.

%X Publication of articles in so called “reputed” journals and achieving high citation counts for the publications are becoming increasingly important in establishing the scientific achievements of individual scholars and institutions.  Given that a journal’s reputation is based predominantly on the extent to which its articles are cited, some editors, reviewers, and journal publishers tend to overtly request references to their articles or journals. This is justifiably found unethical by many of us. However, we shall argue that such explicit requests for referencing is only the tip of the iceberg. There is a widespread, covert understanding among potential authors that unless they cite work of editors and/or have references to the journal where one is submitting a manuscript, the probability of getting the paper accepted for publication may suffer. This consideration is a much more powerful influence than the overt requests some may have experienced as authors. Overt, as well as covert, activities aimed at bumping up individual and journal citations is a dysfunctional result of an increasingly competitive scholarly environment, where the value of success is high, and failure is a very unpleasant option. In the short run, making the community aware of dysfunctional behaviors with respect to citations might help counteract the most blatant exertion of power. However, addressing the more covert use of power requires a more in depth look at ourselves and the way we conduct and assess scholarship. In the long run, the IS field may even need to seriously assess the extent to which our research efforts serve standards primarily internal to our field (similar to rites of other tribes) rather than delivering value to society.

%X This paper is a tutorial on Internet privacy.   The objective of the tutorial is to inform users of the Internet how and why their use of the Internet can be monitored.   The focus of the tutorial is Internet privacy at home and in the work place.  The tutorial contains three major sections: Technical Background, Privacy At Home and Privacy At Work.  The At Home section is concerned with personal privacy infringement.  This section details who would be interested in personal privacy infringement, for what purpose, and how they would accomplish it. The At Home section also discusses techniques on how to avoid privacy infringement.  The At Work section is concerned with employee surveillance. Topics discussed  include who would be interested in this surveillance, for what purpose, and how this surveillance would be carried out.  The At Work section also discusses the concept of an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)   Both of these sections require a bit of technical expertise to understand how Internet activity can be monitored.  The Technical Background section and the Appendix review the client/server paradigm of web computing, the important details of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and presents an overview of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs).  These concepts are necessary to understand how Internet activity can be monitored.

%X With the ever-increasing importance of information quality (IQ), research focuses mainly on two approaches, criteria and assessment. Researchers developed a number of frameworks, criteria lists, and approaches for assessing and measuring IQ. Several studies confirm that IQ is a multi-criteria concept, and its evaluation should consider different aspects. However, research and discussions with practitioners indicate that assessing and managing IQ in organizations remains challenging. Despite the subjective character of quality, foremost frameworks and assessment methodologies do not often consider the context in which the assessment is performed. Trade-offs between criteria are often not considered in most frameworks despite strong evidence in the literature that suggests trade-off relations exist. Underlying a user-centric view, this study analyses the importance of selected contextual factors and their impact on IQ criteria. Empirical data are gathered using a questionnaire approach. Results suggest significant context impacts and show that the perceived importance of information quality criteria changed over the last decade. Information and communication technology, available resources, the user role, the department, and the type of information systems influence respondents’ perception of IQ. These factors are incorporated in a context-oriented IQ research framework.

%X Business information technology alignment (BITA) has been found to improve firm performance. Yet little is known about the process through which firms achieve BITA. Less is known about this process in China, the fastest-growing economy in the world. We conducted case studies with two Chinese firms. We first used the Strategic Alignment Maturity assessment model to evaluate these two firms’ BITA degree. Then we applied punctuated equilibrium Theory to study the firms’ dynamic BITA changing process. The results reveal BITA revolutions and identify their external and internal antecedents. Consistent with prior research, we find that the competitive environment, macro environment, performance deterioration, leadership change, and perception transformation contribute to revolutionary changes of BITA. More important, we find some unique impetuses of revolutionary changes of BITA in China, which include government support, organizational inertia, and social culture preferences. Theoretical and managerial implications of these findings are discussed.

%X The idea that KM can help people in large, often widely geographically dispersed organizations find out who has subject matter expertise or who knows how and where to get at important know-how is intrinsically appealing to knowledge managers. After all, helping people access the knowledge they need is fundamentally what KM is all about. Early approaches to expertise location and management (ELM) typically built skills repositories, but these have not been successful in accomplishing these objectives. As a result, expertise location and management is now on the steep downward slope of the KM "hype cycle" in most organizations. This paper explores the question of whether ELM is an idea that is evolving and maturing and which will ultimately deliver on its promised value, or whether organizations should simply give up on the idea as being not worth the effort. To explore this issue in more detail and to better understand how organizations are conceptualizing and implementing this specific KM initiative, the authors convened a focus group of practicing KM managers from a variety of organizations. This paper first situates the topic of expertise location -- where it fits in with other KM issues and also how our understanding of this topic has evolved over time. It next describes some of the benefits and challenges of ELM. Following this, it explores several different approaches to these types of initiatives. From these, we derive a number of principles for effective ELM implementations. Finally, we present some practical advice for managers who are considering using ELM in their organizations. The paper concludes that ELM has the potential to be a "killer app" for KM, but only if it can be focused and designed effectively to appropriately integrate technology with human facilitation.

Starting with a definition of a technology roadmap, the paper outlines the benefits attributable to a well-crafted roadmap and presents a 7-step model for its creation. According to the focus group, companies without the guidance of a roadmap run the risk of making sub-optimal decisions - technology choices that make sense today but position the company poorly for the future. The focus group also argued that the exercise of developing a technology roadmap is valuable even if the actual roadmap that is developed is subject to frequent change. This paper represents a summary of the focus group discussion.

The study also examines the working-life requirements of today’s IT project managers and assesses the potential of project-based learning in promoting the development of the necessary skills and knowledge for successful project management. The data were collected and combined from three different sources: Recent graduates (questionnaires, n=185) were asked to identify the most important skills they needed in their work; project managers (interviews, n=15) were asked their opinions of the contents and methods used when educating IT project managers; and students (interviews, n=58) were asked what they had learned during the project-based course. According to a comparative analysis of the three sets of data, the respondent groups were unanimous regarding two aspects of working-life requirements and learning outcomes: domain-specific knowledge and social skills. The graduates and the project managers saw these as vital in the work of IT professionals, and the students mentioned them as the most important learning outcomes. The findings suggest that project-based learning may provide students with a learning environment that prepares them well for their future working lives.

%X Currently, the companies that have introduced the ERP system in Taiwan are mostly large enterprises. Due to the high cost of introduction and uncertain performance, however, ordinary small- and medium-sized enterprises can hardly afford the system. Thus, not only would a reference model for ERP life offer cycle-wide management support and assist large enterprises in evaluating and renewing the system, but it would also offer small- and medium-sized enterprises a set of procedures to successfully introduce the ERP system. The objective of this research is to explore the life cycle-wide management and support activities of an ERP system in order to establish a managerial model which can be used as a guideline for managers in dealing with their critical managerial activities. This study applied both the results from the literature review and Delphi study on the basis of Gowin's Vee Approach. Through literature review, this research initially determined the life cycle-wide activities of the ERP system and then used the Grounded Theory to develop a prototype of the reference model for ERP life cycle-wide management and support. Subsequently, this study used the Delphi Method to collect the opinions of field experts. After analyzing and organizing the results, comparison and amendments were made to propose a final set of reference models for ERP life cycle-wide management and support. From the perspective of academic research, the authors believe that this study contributes to the development of a managerial model and provides prospective researchers with future directions in this subject area. As for the business sector, this managerial model can assist large enterprises through a better approach in management and support of the current ERP system, while small- and medium-sized enterprises are provided with a set of concrete steps to facilitate the successful introduction of the ERP system.

%X Considering the ongoing concerns regarding enrollments in MIS programs, it is necessary for MIS educators to understand the underlying motivations that influence student choices of major, as well as how students view the field of MIS related to these factors.  To address this problem, a series of focus group sessions were conducted on three distinct samples of students which examined the following questions:  (1) What factors influence a business student’s selection of a field of study and/or career? (2) What factors encourage or deter a business student’s choice to enter the field of MIS? and (3) What strategies can an MIS department employ to increase awareness about MIS-related careers among business students?  Results from these focus groups suggest that most students rated job scope as an important issue in their deciding on a major; however, students with little or no knowledge of MIS perceived this career path as narrowly focused (e.g., sitting at a computer and coding all day).  Results also suggest that non-MIS majors held more negative perceptions of the characteristics associated with MIS professionals, whereas freshman and sophomore students declaring MIS as their future major held more positive perceptions than non-MIS majors, and junior and senior MIS majors held even more positive perceptions.

%X Mental models are personal tools developed by students to help them apply ideas they have learned to solve problems. If students are not required to reflect on the adequacy of their current mental models, they risk arriving at suboptimal solutions due to knowledge gaps or misapplication of theory. After critically reflecting on the capstone project reports from students in an undergraduate information systems strategy and planning course, we argue that our students require a deeper and broader understanding of alternative management theories in order to become more effective and creative problem solvers. Furthermore, students must be made explicitly aware of the existence of (and adequacy of) their mental models using techniques such as concept mapping and critical reflection. Our solution to the problem of knowledge gaps is not to "push" more content to students, but to enable students to "pull" new ideas into their mental models once they recognize their existing mental models are inadequate. An action learning approach that combines problem-based learning, student-centered inquiry, concept mapping, and critical reflection can help students self-diagnose and treat their knowledge gaps. This in turn helps students develop into more effective, creative, and motivated critical thinkers and problem solvers.

%X This article introduces an electronic commerce paradox by observing that while electronic commerce grows rapidly it is, at the same time, based on unsettled foundations. It describes how 22 constraints for global electronic commerce were identified, and analyzes them in depth. The constraints fall into four themes: 1. Building trust for users and consumers 2. Establishing ground rules for the digital marketplace 3. Enhancing information infrastructure 4. Maximizing benefits.   Each of these themes contains a number of critical issues. The first theme--building trust for users and consumers--involves privacy protection, security, consumer protection, authentication and confidentiality, and access blocking. The second theme includes legal framework, acceptance of electronic transactions, taxation, tariffs, intellectual property protection, commercial policy, and payment systems. Enhancing information infrastructure covers the needed infrastructure enhancements and includes Internet infrastructure and governance, interconnectivity and technical convergence, technical standards, bandwidth and accessibility, and the question of how to further the competition. The last theme is about maximizing the benefits of electronic commerce and includes the understanding of digital economy, its measurement, seamless globalization, and involvement of small businesses. At the time that this paper was written (February 2000) none of these 22 issues had been resolved. Yet, they need to be worked out if electronic commerce is to be successful in both the developed and the underdeveloped world.

%X The availability and promise of social networking technologies with their perceived open philosophy has increasingly inspired citizens around the world to participate in political activity on the Web. Recent examples range from opposing public policies, such as government funding cuts, to organizing revolutionary social movements, such as those in the Middle East and North Africa. Although online spaces create remarkable opportunities for various forms of political action, there are concerns over the power of existing institutions to control and even censor such interaction spaces. The objective of this article is to draw together different insights on the online engagement phenomenon, highlighting both its potential and limitations as a mechanism for fostering democratic debate and influencing policy making. We examine recent examples from Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. Finally, we summarize the implications of our work and outline directions for further research.

%X Virtual communities provide an attractive place for organizations to mine information regarding customer perceptions, needs, and demographics; as well as to generate revenue through sales of products, services, information, and advertising. However, the community conversation provides information about only one type of community user, the poster. Information about the lurker, who never posts, is conspicuously absent from the obvious community data source, the postings. Lurkers may be a large portion of the user community and could provide key revenue sources and vital information, or they potentially could turn into posters.   This research contrasts the differences in the underlying motivations of lurkers, infrequent posters, and posters in order to understand the resulting differences in their behavior. 518 users from 20 virtual communities were categorized into three groups based upon their posting behaviors: lurkers who never posted, infrequent posters who posted three or less times per month, and frequent posters. Results revealed that lurkers differed significantly from posters, especially in their willingness to give information and exchange social support. There was a gradual progression from lurker to poster regarding the desires to get knowledge and obtain shopping information. Implications about a possible psychological barrier regarding giving information and social support are discussed.

%X This editorial is an introduction to a focus issue on legacy information systems research that has been conducted under the aegis of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) research programme into systems engineering and business process change. An overview of the legacy information systems problem is presented in terms of its scale, definition, and relevance to practicing managers and academics. It is shown that legacy systems represent a critical area of study in both software engineering and strategic information systems. The legacy system issues include the software methods and costs of maintaining and evolving existing systems, the technical problems of migrating complex legacy systems to new technology, and the difficulties of designing and implementing novel business processes in the context of existing structures, strategies and systems. In addition to the problems associated with legacy systems, the strategic opportunities of exploiting legacy systems are also outlined. Six related papers, which together cover the identification of the problem, planning and modelling of change, and the implementation of new systems and business processes, are described.

%X The domain of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems is an enduring paradigm for Information Systems (IS) researchers. The Enterprise System paradigm provides a rich environment to test fundamental concepts like system adoption, system use and system success, while acknowledging changes derived through longer system lifecycles and multiple user cohorts. On the other hand, ERP systems are in the centre of new contemporary radical changes in technologies on cloud computing, mobile platforms and big data. Moreover, ERP Systems provide the context for cross disciplinary research such as change management, knowledge management, project management and business process management research. This article provides a critique of 219 papers published on ERP Systems from 2006–2012, making observations of ERP research and make recommendations for future research directions.

%X A number of well-documented, fundamental assumptions are associated with strategic information systems planning (SISP). A core activity for this domain is the alignment of an organisations systems and technology strategy with its business objectives. The difficulty is the complex and diverse nature of the strategy process itself that renders such a match increasingly problematic. The evidence within the literature relating to SISP suggests that it does not fully mirror contemporary business strategy and contains some fundamentally incorrect assumptions. This paper identifies eight such assumptions that propose a number of challenges for future research directions. Case examples are also presented which reflect the issues posed for exploiting the value of Information Technology (IT) as a strategic opportunity given the approaches adopted for SISP. Finally, a number of challenges to SISP are noted which relate to identified categories, through an 'IS complexity framework', of reviewing benefits, managing business change, and assessing organisational competencies for sustainable competitive advantage.

%X A team-based project is a common feature of information systems courses involving analysis and design.  The use of a project assignment helps to promote active learning through hands-on engagement within a collaborative learning context.  Various strategies are available for staging such projects including field projects and projects based on written cases.  Each of these options tends to have advantages and disadvantages, relative to the richness of the experience and the predictability and reliability of learning outcomes.  This paper reports on an innovative approach, the Virtual Interactive Project (VIP), that explores the middle ground between field projects and text-based projects in an effort to achieve some of the advantages of both.  Like the text-based project, the VIP is launched by means of a written case; however, this case gives only enough facts to get the project underway.  The project then evolves through web-based and email interaction between students and a "virtual client" representing the firm in the case.  By engaging students as players in an unfolding story the VIP becomes, in effect, "drama" and amplifies active learning by tapping the centrality of narrative in knowledge construction.  Early experiences with the Virtual Interactive Project are described, and some directions for its further development and application are suggested.

This case presents a detailed, factually accurate chronology of one customer's attempt to purchase two products through the Internet. It focuses on the customer's decision about which merchant to buy from and his subsequent actions when the merchant does not deliver as promised. Overall, it illustrates some of the problems that occur when order fulfillment processes break down.

The initial case examines two distinct topics: First, it introduces VOIP technology and traces the development of commercial applications from 1995 to 2003. Second, it considers issues of strategic alignment by raising the question of whether eBay should have allied with or acquired Skype SA. The second case provides an epilogue set two years after the acquisition that examines the intermediate outcomes of the Skype integration.

%X Despite the magnitude of the Internet phenomenon, relatively few studies investigate the factors influencing its diffusion.  This paper seeks to provide a better understanding of the forces that influence the diffusion of the Internet in Singapore.  A push-pull framework that incorporates the political, technological, economic, and social factors is developed as the basis for examining this phenomenon.  Based on this framework, a content-analytic approach is used to analyze the messages conveyed in Singapore's two local English-medium newspapers.  The results show that both push and pull forces  predominated in the early stages of Internet diffusion.  However, as time went by, the pull forces predominated over the push forces.  The results also show that factors such as building telecommunication infrastructure, having on-line information and services, and creating business opportunities were important in the diffusion of the Internet in Singapore.

This paper prescribes an integrated IT investment management process incorporating four recommended activities:         *strategic planning,        *quality function deployment,        *activity analysis, and        *responsibility assignment.   The process, tools, methods, and organizational learning were drawn from two projects at Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.  The integrated process for IT investment management can help senior IS executives prioritize projects and align responsibility and accountability for IT initiatives that require complementary organizational changes to activities across the entire value chain to realize full benefits.

%X Most research on structuration or the appropriation of ICT in organizations has put aside the problem of dyschronies. It has not taken into account the differences in nature, speed, and temporality of changes that co-exist within an organization. To address this limitation, the author of this paper suggests a model based on the theory of practice and neo-institutionalist perspectives, so as to make sense of the co-evolution of intra-organizational fields. This model, which proposes a balance between various institutional tensions, has been worked out inductively from a longitudinal case study on communication fields within the Roman Curia, the administrative headquarters of the Catholic Church located in the Vatican. These tensions are related to socio-technical, socio-theological, socio-organizational, and socio-economic areas. A set of propositions regarding the link between intra-organizational fields and tensions and the relationships between intra-organizational fields (parallel, convergent, and competing evolutions) is proposed.

%X Identity Management has been a serious problem since the establishment of the Internet. Yet little progress has been made toward an acceptable solution. Early Identity Management Systems (IdMS) were designed to control access to resources and match capabilities with people in well-defined situations, Today’s computing environment involves a variety of user and machine centric forms of digital identities and fuzzy organizational boundaries. With the advent of inter-organizational systems, social networks, e-commerce, m-commerce, service oriented computing, and automated agents, the characteristics of IdMS face a large number of technical and social challenges. The first part of the tutorial describes the history and conceptualization of IdMS, current trends and proposed paradigms, identity lifecycle, implementation challenges and social issues. The second part addresses standards, industry initia-tives, and vendor solutions. We conclude that there is disconnect between the need for a universal, seamless, trans-parent IdMS and current proposed standards and vendor solutions.

%X We empirically investigate the relationship between information and communication technologies (ICTs) and the delivery of country-level public health. Our underlying hypothesis is that ICTs can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public health delivery mechanisms. In our framework, we include the ICT factors of accessibility, quality, affordability, applications, and institutional efficiency and sustainability. The public health delivery is represented by the changes in the indicators of immunization coverage, TB infection, sanitation, undernourishment, life expectancy, mortality rate, and health care expenses. Results indicate in most cases ICT factors have a significant correlation to a country’s delivery of public health over and above a country’s income level. The “Accessibility” ICT factor contributes to improved delivery for nearly all of the public health indicators. This is followed by “ICT Applications.” Increased ICTs usage leads to increased health care expenditure. Our findings are useful at the country level for informing policy decisions regarding the nature and extent of investment in ICT infrastructure for the delivery of public health. We do caution that merely investing in more ICTs does not imply an automatic improvement in public health. Rather, ICTs have the potential to improve the delivery process.

%X The core information systems (IS) course in an MBA program (the foundations IS course required for all students) is typically one of the hardest to teach.  The wide range of student skills and the differing opinions on the content make this course a perennial problem.  Who is  the target audience? What should be the focus of the course? What is the appropriate course content?  What is the proper balance between technical and managerial topics?
%X To help answer these questions this paper investigates the problematic issues surrounding the core IS course and the current pedagogical approaches. An examination of past studies on IS skills seems to suggest academia should consider redesigning the MBA level core IS course. The paper proposes a new IS managerial approach to the course that may better fit the needs of middle and senior managers. This approach differs from previous approaches by making the central focus of the course the skills/knowledge needed by management, particularly general management, for exploiting information technology. A detailed description of a course example following this proposed new approach is provided along with a discussion of the flexibility that this approach offers MBA level IS instructors in achieving various pedagogical objectives. The paper concludes with some limitations associated with the approach and how these limitations can be overcome.

%X Education is often seen as a route to full participation in society, and widening participation in education and lifelong learning as a way of including those who are currently excluded from many of the benefits of society. The use of learning technology (e-learning) is perceived by national governments, the European Union (EU), and academic institutions as a means of widening participation in higher education by enabling participation by nontraditional students. E-learning is perceived as lowering barriers of time and place to enable nontraditional students to attend campus-based education while accessing resources at a time and place of their choosing. Yet, there is dissonance between the espoused belief of governments the EU and academic institutions, in e-learning as a means of widening participation, and the reality of e-learning implementation. The digital divide refers to the gap between those who have access to the information technology, and those who do not. This research finds that the digital divide is not adequately addressed by higher education institutions, with some students financially unable to afford technology and broadband access, others lack the skills to engage with learning technology, and some are culturally less able to benefit from technological enrichment. It also finds gender and generational differences disenfranchising some students. In order to address this situation it will be necessary to first acknowledge that the problem exists.

%X Over the past decade, Web-based learning management systems, such as Blackboard and WebCT, have been gradually integrated into college education. The strategic use and effectiveness of such systems have been investigated to a large extent. What is less covered is what students really think about such learning management systems. Understanding students’ evaluations can shed light on the development, selection, training, maintenance, use, and investment on such systems. In this paper, we report a longitudinal study that uses a bottom-up approach to gather qualitative data on student views of WebCT 6. Data were collected at three distinctive times that spanned two semesters to reflect students’ different experiences in using WebCT 6. Two different methods were used to collect qualitative data so that students could report their views in unconstrained ways. The content analyses results show that (1) students have an integrated view of their technology assisted learning environment, which can be represented by the notion of S-I-A (the system, the instructors and the administrators); (2) as students’ experience with WebCT 6 increases, their complaints and wishes for instructors and administrators increase; (3) communication-related features continuously dominate students’ views about WebCT 6; and (4) as their use of WebCT 6 increases, students grow more appreciative toward WebCT 6 features that support learning activities. The findings contribute to the literature with additional evidence on the nature and effectiveness of learning management systems. They provide a set of suggestions that should be carefully considered by all personnel involved. We identify a number of research implications. One particular research contribution is the identification of a fifth type of interaction that plays an important role in the technology-assisted learning context: the learner-administrator interaction.

%X Forced journal self-citation, as defined in this paper, has serious implications for the IS field.  We introduce a statistical perspective on how common the practice is, discuss whether it is appropriate or not, and evaluate its ethicality.  We find that journal self-citations do influence journal impact factors, a measure of journal quality and a tool for many schools in their promotion and tenure process.  We suggest that forced self-citations  are not considered appropriate by community standards nor are they ethical in terms of the greatest good.  We therefore propose that impact factors be disseminated both with and without self-citations to make the practice of forced self-citation more transparent to the IS community. An example of the proposal is shown.

%X Technology is the driving force behind many of today’s new products, services, and cost-cutting measures. However, there are gaps in our understanding about how technological innovation is fostered and nurtured in organizations. Part of the answer is to examine how Chief Information Officers (CIOs) exercise influence regarding technological innovation in organizations. This is particularly important since the CIO is the head of technology in organizations, an important source of technological innovation. This article draws on an established executive influence framework to demonstrate how Irish CIOs are able to solidify Information Technology’s (IT’s) contribution to technological innovation via relational means. Most of the CIOs in our study were able to successfully influence other executives to support these innovations which led to better IT-business alignment. However, other CIOs in our study were unsuccessful at influencing executives, which increased the disconnection between the CIO and the executive. Building on this study, we suggest significant practices and behaviors that CIOs can use to successfully influence other executives regarding technological innovations. CIOs must recognize that the relational side of technology alignment should be leveraged for them to successfully manage their contribution to technological innovation.

%X The most common approach to network development in the modern organization remains an undocumented, ad hoc method of deploying available technology rapidly to fit within a given cost structure.  Current methods largely ignore the importance of integrating the networking strategy of a firm with the overall information systems architecture of the enterprise.  To address this problem, a new approach to network analysis and design is presented. 	The new method integrates existing principles of information systems analysis and design with the unique requirements imposed by distributed systems.  The integrated approach seeks to provide the organization with a set of guidelines for allocating resources to a computer network based upon the business goals of a firm.  Specifically, the method calls for  (1)	defining the business problem,  (2)	modeling business requirements,  (3)	modeling location requirements,  (4)	developing a network architecture,  (5)	simulating network operation, and  (6)	implementing the network.   The method is illustrated and compared to other network development methods. DEACON is found to be an advantageous approach.

%X This study examines the impact of a reasonable time limit on the effective usage of a computerized decision aid. Using current decision making models, a theoretical argument about decision aid usage is developed. This argument is then investigated via two lab experiments. The first experiment determines a reasonable time limit for the task used in the study. The second experiment investigates users’ behavior and heart rate variability under this time limit. The results of our study indicate that the reasonable time limit determined in the first study improved effective utilization of the computerized decision aid. The analysis of heart rate variability provides evidence that the given time constraint improved users’ cognitive coherence.

%X This paper describes a unique entrepreneurial venture initiation class conducted in the spring 2007 semester at The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. The students of this class started a business together and shared in the value created. The business was a social networking Web site, www.wishfood.com, forming a community of individuals with an interest in food and wishing to share recipes. The course was designed to expose students to the process of starting a business, to teach the technical skills required, and to imbue an entrepreneurial spirit. This paper covers the structure of the course, the contributions of the students, the business timeline, and the outcomes of the course. This paper will allow a professor to replicate and learn from the successes and failures of the course.

%X Les contenus publiés sur le Web ne cessant de s'accroître, il devient vital de les gérer de façon efficiente. Les organisations sont plus que jamais à la recherche de moyens pour gérer le plus efficacement possible et de façon rentable le contenu de leurs sites web. Les Systèmes de Gestion du Contenu (SGC) sont proposés pour répondre à ce besoin en facilitant la création des sites web et la gestion de leur contenu. Nombreuses sont les organisations qui ont recours aux SGC. Cet intérêt est visible dans la croissance du marché des logiciels de SGC ainsi que dans les mises à jour régulières des logiciels SGC existants.  Pour une organisation, le choix du logiciel SGC n'est pas un processus très facile. En effet, ce marché est très dynamique et réparti entre de nombreux producteurs. Le processus d'évaluation de l'offre demande des outils spécifiques. C'est pour aider les organisations dans leur choix que nous avons tenté d'apporter un cadre d'analyse de ces logiciels. La réalisation de ce cadre d'analyse pour aider les organisations dans leur choix contribue à faciliter l'évaluation des SGC. Cet article propose un cadre d'analyse des logiciels SGC et explique son application sur un échantillon de 23 logiciels. L'importance de cet échantillon permet également d'estimer les regroupements stratégiques des logiciels SGC. En effet, l'analyse conduite a fait ressortir l'existence de deux groupes stratégiques qui se différencient principalement de par les caractéristiques des logiciels ainsi que par leur marché cible.

%X The practice of a publisher requiring authors to include citations to previous articles in the publisher’s journals is widely acknowledged to be inappropriate.  This paper presents the reasons why that is so.  It considers possible means whereby the practice could be subjected to control, and concludes that the primary regulatory vehicle is the Code of Research Conduct of the Association for Information Systems (AIS).  The framework created by the original 2003 Code is described, and the extensions approved in principle by the AIS Council in December 2008 are shown to greatly enhance the discipline's ability to bring pressure to bear on publishers that misbehave in this way.

%X Risk management can be an extremely powerful approach to dealing with the complexities and uncertainties that increasingly surround technological change and its management. Conventionally in information technology (IT) projects, risks have been narrowly defined. Today, with IT becoming integral to a company's existence, the stakes are considerably higher and broader in scope. However, risk is sometimes seen a negative concept in information systems (IS) organizations because it implies that something could go wrong with an IT project. To understand effective risk management in IS, the authors convened a focus group of senior IS managers from a number of organizations in a variety of industries. The results of this discussion, the managers' presentations, and a review of the current research on risk management, were integrated and are presented in this paper. The nature of risk, identifying risk in IT initiatives, determining appropriate levels of risk, and dealing with unacceptable types and levels of risk are discussed. The following conclusions were reached. Risk management is a means to an end - whether it is a successful IS project; stable, secure technical operations; or a properly implemented business strategy using technology. It is not a one-time activity, but rather an ongoing process of identification, assessment, and action, which needs to be well integrated into every part of IS management. IS managers must learn to control both the problems and the potential that risk represents. Several general principles to help IS managers deal effectively with risks were identified. Effective risk management involves taking a holistic approach to risk, developing a risk management policy, establishing clear accountabilities and responsibilities, balancing risk exposure against controls, being open about risks to reduce conflict and information hiding, enforcing risk management practices, and learning what works and doesn't from past experience.

%X Higher education in the United States has recently come under pressure from federal and state legislatures for failing to provide "value for money" because of an alleged lack of accountability and quality [U.S. Department of Education 2006].  This article will argue that, contrary to this view, institutes of higher learning have a rigorous quality assurance and accountability mechanism in place, namely accreditation, and that, moreover, the recent shift in accreditation from an input-based approach to an outcomes-based approach has resulted in improved programs that prepare graduates better than ever before for the workforce and/or further studies.  These measures in fact are well applied in the field of information systems.  The paper focuses on accreditation and the role of accreditation in ensuring quality in education. The work of agencies that are of most interest to information systems programs, namely the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) and the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET Inc (ABET CAC) is reviewed.  The paper also describes a process to aid those interested in improving educational quality.

While there are many good practices that an organization can adopt to manage information security and privacy, there are also underlying areas of contention about the protection of personal information in a digital environment. This ICIS panel considered three challenges facing businesses in developing effective strategies for information security and privacy—innovating with personal information, building robust governance models, and connecting security and privacy with business goals. In the process, the panel brought together a range of research disciplines and senior business representatives to critique current practice and develop a future research agenda.

%X Despite the business importance attached to the choice of features in organizational Web sites, most research on the subject is descriptive in nature. To our knowledge, no study has attempted to understand the underlying theoretical rationale explaining firms’ choice of Web site features. Adoption of innovative systems by organizations is not always a “rational decision” based on the market innovation perspective; it may be based on the organizations’ decision to conform to the “institutionalized norms” within or across the industries. In a similar vein, the underlying rationale for the firms’ choice of Web site features may be either predominantly “rational” or “institutional.” We use Web content analysis to examine the dominant theoretical perspective guiding the organizational Web sites: rational (differentiation) or institutional (alikeness). For this, we analyze the data recorded from 243 Web sites: 91 information technology firms (IT industry), 67 business schools (education industry) and 85 banks (banking industry). Data pertaining to 20 features of Web sites are classified into information and interactive contents within and across three industries. Results suggest that Web site features are primarily explained by intra-industry norms of alikeness rather than inter-industry similarities, thereby supporting the preponderance of “institutional perspective” for Web site features within each of the three industries examined. In contrast, differences in Web site features across the three industries can be explained using the “rational perspective.” Thus, both rational and institutional perspectives serve as useful theoretical lenses for understanding choice of organizational Web site features. The study also delineates a set of implications for research and practice.

%X While information technologies we employ in business, government, and society have dramatically enhanced our ability to conduct commerce, the vulnerabilities of these systems create potential dangers not often fully apprehended. As an example, criminal and terrorist groups have demonstrated a sophisticated understanding of how to adapt organizational forms and information technologies to advance their agendas, regardless of how contemptible these may be. In this article, we consider how these groups may view information technology and systems both as means by which they may more effectively organize themselves and as potential targets as they subvert the underlying societal assumptions regarding the technology itself. Topics such as these have implications for both IS research and practice because the changing nature of warfare means entities that may have until recently been seen as “non-combatant” are no longer viewed as such; any organization’s online resources may be regarded and serviced as legitimate targets. This fact, coupled with the interconnectedness of the global economy, makes it imperative to understand the potential threat—whether this is acted on by criminals, terrorists, or even by hostile nation states—and place greater emphasis on defending vital systems against such attacks.

%X The process of developing large-scale business critical software systems must boost the productivity both of the users and the developers of software, while at the same time responding  flexibly to changing business requirements in the face of sharpening competition. Historically, these two forces were viewed as mutually hostile. Component-based software development using object technology promises a way of mediating the apparent contradiction.  This paper presents a successful new approach which focuses primarily on the architecture of the software system to migrate an existing system to a new form. Best practice is captured by software patterns that address not only the design, but also the process and organizational issues. The approach was developed through four completed, successful live projects in different business and technical areas. It resulted in a still-evolving pattern language called ADAPTOR (Architecture-Driven and Pattern-based Techniques for Object Re-engineering).  This article outlines the approach that underlies ADAPTOR. It challenges popular notions of legacy systems by emphasizing business requirements. Architectural approaches to migration are then contrasted with traditional reverse engineering approaches, including the weakness of reverse engineering in the face of paradigm shifts. The evolution of the ADAPTOR pattern language is outlined with a brief history of the projects from which the patterns were abstracted.

%X The content published on the Web never stops growing. It is becoming essential to efficiently manage it. Organizations are increasingly searching for more efficient and feasible ways in which to manage the content of their websites. Content Management Systems offer a solution by facilitating the creation of websites and providing content management. Many organizations are now using Management Content Systems. This increasing interest is apparent in the growing market of such systems and in the updates of existing systems.  For an organization, the choice of a Content Management System is not easy, since this is a dynamic market shared among many different publishers. The offer evaluation process requires specific tools. In order to help these organizations in their choice, we have attempted to provide an analysis framework for these applications. This analysis framework designed to help organizations choose their application contributes to the evaluation of these applications. This article puts forward a Content Management software analysis framework and explains its application to a sample of 23 products. The size of this sample allows us to asses the strategic grouping of Content Management Systems. Effectively, the analysis results in the identification of two strategic groups whose main differences lay in the software characteristics and their target markets.

%X Delivery of healthcare services presents many challenges for governments in most developing countries. Some of these challenges include financial and human resources issues that might affect governments' ability to manage and transform scarce resources to meet healthcare needs. Telemedicine, a healthcare delivery technology where physicians examine patients from distant locations using information technologies, is reported to be increasingly helpful in meeting the needs of the healthcare sector in developing nations such as those in sub-Saharan Africa. This conceptual study reports on the sectoral adoption of telemedicine in Ethiopia, a sub-Saharan African country. We examine the potential benefits of telemedicine diffusion in Ethiopia, addressing the country's healthcare needs, and discussing the obstacles and challenges. Based on previous literature, as well as experiences drawn from other developing nations, we address three potential factors that could influence the diffusion of telemedicine in Ethiopia: active participation of institutions of higher education, Ethiopian foreign alliances, and government involvement. Although the initial successes are relatively small and involve isolated projects, they have been promising and have set the stage for researchers to investigate prevailing projects so as to gain better understanding of the aforementioned factors. Our study does not claim that telemedicine can solve all of Ethiopia's medical challenges; however, we contend that it is a starting point to reach Africans that live in areas with limited medical facilities and personnel. Hence, our study could have far reaching implications as the world looks to help this country, and by extension, other developing countries, to overcome their medical challenges and join the information society.

Which innovations, platforms, and paradigms will become dominant, and which others will ultimately pass into obscurity? Thoughts on these questions are provided by those with a unique and unmatched perspective.  The leaders who have witnessed the birth and development of the IS field during the past forty to fifty years draw on their experiences and their deep knowledge of the field to identify the characteristics of technologies that have changed business in the past. They also explain how and why today’s innovations will change both research and practice going forward. Their insights have the potential to identify topics for researchers to examine now and in the years to come.

%X Social capital is a very influential concept in social science in understanding contemporary societies. It is found to directly and indirectly influence many aspects of social life, such as quality of life. It is also increasingly explored in relation to Information and Communications Technology (ICT). However, little is known about the relationship between ICT and social capital. The study of the relationship is still in its early stages and has not produced consistent results. This paper sets out to provide an analytical review of the literature focusing on the relationship between the two in order to understand how ICT affects social capital and vice versa. It begins by presenting a review of social capital and then builds a framework to classify and organize ICT related social capital studies. Using this framework, we provide an analysis of existing studies in the area. On the basis of this analysis, we identify three gaps in the ICT related social capital research: an imbalance in the levels of analysis between the collective and the individual levels, a lack of theoretical explanation of why and how social capital changes due to ICT, and the limited ability of the research findings to be generalized. We then make suggestions for future research.

%X Recent years have witnessed many organizations switching from function-oriented to customer-centric in their information systems applications designs. This paradigm shift has attracted growing attention among researchers in better understanding the design process of customer-centric IS applications; an area that has not been investigated adequately so far. This paper examines the processes of gathering and segmenting customer-centric attributes during the design stage of an IS application development by analyzing data extracted from a successful case of developing an online property auction site. The findings reveal that gathering and segmenting customer-centric attributes during the design stage of a customer-centric IS application development encompass four phases: (1) Identify customer requirements; (2) Structure customer requirements; (3) Link customer requirements to system design attributes; and (4) Review the level of customer satisfaction with the new system. We discuss the implications of our findings for both research and practice.

%X Globalizing organizations, outsourcing, mobile work, inter-organizational teams, innovation, and reaching out to suppliers and customers are driving today’s need to improve collaboration within firms. And information technology (IT) is at the center of these trends. Businesses are also experimenting with different types of collaboration. While IT functions provide the “heavy lifting,” such as connectivity and information integrity, without which most collaboration efforts would not be effective, how new applications are implemented is often as important as the technology itself in delivering business value. This article explores IT’s role in enabling collaboration in organizations, and at the same time, what IT’s role should not be (i.e., what responsibilities and accountabilities should properly be the function of the business). It presents the results of research with a focus group of senior IT managers, looking first at why collaboration is becoming so important and the business value it enables. Next, it examines some of the different characteristics of collaboration and the key components of a collaboration program and at IT’s role in one. It concludes that effective collaboration will not result from implementing more collaboration software. Instead, this will require a proactive and holistic strategy that integrates business goals and technology potential.

%X This paper puts forward an academic identity for the IS discipline which emerges out of its displayed academic artifacts – namely, papers published in two of the discipline’s major journals (Information Systems Research and MIS Quarterly) between 1977 and 2006. Our study focuses on two specific attributes of these papers: the focal IT Artifact and the IS Theme. An analysis of 1056 papers reveals an academic identity characterized by a relatively persistent focus on a small set of IT Artifacts and a similarly small set of IS Themes. The analysis suggests that our academic identity is indicated by two central and enduring intellectual cores associated with a handful of IT Artifacts and IS Themes, which have captured the attention of IS researchers over three decades. This academic identity may be described as the scientific study of the design, development, and management of information technologies, as well as their use by and impact on individuals, groups, and organizations. Of particular interest are information technologies (and their specific components) that enable communication, collaboration, and decision making. A follow up analysis of the papers published in 2007 and 2008 provides support to the central and enduring nature of our discipline’s intellectual core.

%X Business process management (BPM) is a still-emerging field in the academic discipline of Information Systems (IS). This article reflects on a workshop on current and future issues in BPM research that was conducted by seventeen IS researchers from eight European countries as part of the 2010 annual meeting of the European Research Center for Information Systems (ERCIS). The results of this workshop suggest that BPM research can meaningfully contribute to investigating a broad variety of phenomena that are of interest to IS scholars, ranging from rather technical (e.g., the implementation of software architectures) to managerial (e.g., the impact of organizational culture on process performance). It further becomes noticeable that BPM researchers can make use of several research strategies, including qualitative, quantitative, and design-oriented approaches. The article offers the participants’ outlook on the future of BPM research and combines their opinions with research results from the academic literature on BPM, with the goal of contributing to establishing BPM as a distinct field of research in the IS discipline.

%X Offshore outsourcing has increased to the point where it is now part of the mainstream consciousness.  The same tools that enable remote work sharing in corporations also allow individuals to outsource their own work (microsourcing)—either with company approval or covertly. As an innovative work practice, microsourcing can bring greater flexibility to the workforce. It also has the potential to undermine control of the work process as well as introducing new risks and ethical issues to the workplace.  The appearance of brokers to facilitate microsourcing suggests that entrepreneurs perceive there is a demand for these arrangements. Due to the potential threats to intellectual property, even employers and managers who do not use or approve of the practice should take some steps to educate themselves about microsourcing. This research is the first known attempt to use a theoretical framework to understand microsourcing as an individual level work strategy as well as its context and drivers. This study uses Structuration Theory as a guideline in the investigation of different microsourcing implementations.

%X This case is a follow on to "Colorado Benefits Management System: Decision Time" (McCubbrey and Fukami, 2005). It chronicles the events in the two years that followed the ill-advised conversion of the Colorado Benefits Management System (CBMS). CBMS was converted over the objections of the user community and after the expenditure of approximately $100 million. The results were both predictable and avoidable. The system was fraught with errors, and the fallback plan was never implemented. Clients, principally the poor and elderly, suffered as a result of the system's errors and poor performance. An audit conducted by the State of Colorado found that millions of dollars had been misspent after conversion. As of August 2006, CBMS remains a troubled system and has received a considerable amount of unfavorable publicity in the local and national media. Colorado counties are struggling to use the system and worker morale is suffering. A lawsuit against the State is pending. The case concludes by asking: Who is to blame for this mess? Why is it taking so long to fix? What could have been done differently to avoid the resulting chaos? What should be done to repair CBMS? How can progress be measured?

%X This study outlines the findings of a qualitative study designed to develop an understanding of nurses’ experiences using an electronic medical record system (EMR) in a mandatory usage context. Drawing upon the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, a combined deductive/inductive research approach was adopted to study nurses working in an urban hospital system. This approach allowed for an in-depth study of the nature and structure of mandated information systems (IS) use in a healthcare context. We found that understanding the relationship between key technology acceptance constructs and system use required a multidimensional conceptualization of usage – something not commonly found in the IS literature. We identified three facets important to gaining a holistic understanding of nurses’ use of EMR technology: time spent using the system, timing of use, and mode of use. We empirically demonstrate that the dimensions of IS use can be mandated and internalized to varying degrees even within the same organization, and that the predictors of use can be differentially associated with the dimensions of use given the degree of the mandate.

%X In the first six months of 1999 the Russian Federation government instituted a wide range of policies related  to fixing the Year 2000 Problem, culminating in an attempt to pass a Y2K Law, a Presidential Decree, and other governmental actions. Many systems are not expected to be fully remediated in time.  Drawing extensively on Russian sources, this paper outlines the evolution of government policies, gives an overview of the state of Y2K remediation as of July 1999, and outlines the key provisions of the government's policies. It is concluded that the Russian government's  largely administrative approach to solving the Y2K problem is fairly ineffective and may lead to wider ranging consequences for the economic system as a whole.

%X In this paper, we studied the public’s opinion of outsourcing and offshoring as reflected in political cartoons.  Researchers in many fields have used political cartoons to track public opinion, yet we are unaware of any such research in the field of IS.  We analyzed the content of 165 political cartoons from the U.S. and India that depict offshoring and outsourcing.  Overall, U.S./Western political cartoons portray outsourcing and offshoring negatively, causing lost jobs for workers and poorer customer service for consumers.  Indian political cartoons focus on jobs gained and the labor and infrastructure constraints caused by the rapid growth of ITO and BPO industries.  We also compared the content of political cartoons to IS academic research.  We found both similarities and differences.  One similarity is that lower costs were found to be the most common reason depicted/cited for outsourcing/offshoring in political cartoons and IS academic research.  One difference is that political cartoonists primarily empathize and thus promote the interests of the workers, direct supervisors, and customers most affected by outsourcing/offshoring whereas IS researchers primarily promote the interests of the firm.  We also discuss the use of political cartoons as an effective pedagogical device in global outsourcing courses.

%X Control and flexibility may appear an unlikely pair. However, we propose that effective flexible software development processes must still provide clear control mechanisms to manage the progress and quality of the resulting software products. This paper presents a conceptual study to understand the types of control found in flexible software development processes, termed controlled-flexible approaches. Control theory is used as a lens to study the control mechanisms found in plan-driven and flexible processes. We extend current thinking to include emergent outcome controls and clan controls for team coordination in our taxonomy of control mechanisms. Several popular flexible processes are analyzed for control mechanisms. We conclude with a brief discussion of future research directions.

%X This paper recognizes the need for process-based transformation in today’s organizations and argues for the establishment of a new organizational role—the enterprise business architect (EBA) —capable of leading enterprise-wide as opposed to a functional change. The paper first reviews the nature of business processes with respect to their three main constituencies: customers, employees, and technology. Next, a description of the EBA role including duties, skills, responsibilities, and overall mandate is presented. Based on this, various career development strategies are suggested for prospective EBAs and an argument is made for the appropriate organizational positioning for this new role. The paper concludes with a challenge to IT to step up to this new opportunity to reshape organizations.

%X To envisage possible future enterprise systems, we describe four scenarios that all respond to the increasing need for better supply chain-wide coordination of resource allocation decisions. We use two drivers to derive these scenarios; namely “normal form of providing corporate computing resources” and “stance of regulators towards explicit forms of industry-wide coordination”, the latter of which includes cooperation among competitors. While three of our scenarios are familiar to contemporary readers, the fourth, supply chain resource planning (SCRP) systems, marks a radical break with current practice. We describe the operating principle of SCRP systems and discuss possible governance structures for organizations supporting SCRP systems. We hope to encourage discussion about the future of enterprise systems that moves beyond extrapolating past and current trends. The paper concludes by outlining four areas for promising future research.

%X In this interpretive case study we examine the processes and the related information systems (IS) fostering user influence in a large scale e-banking case. Our focus is user involvement in the IS evolution by enhancing and utilizing unsolicited feedback and initiatives. As a result, we develop a new conceptualization of feedback and initiative management. Organizations may utilize this model and the related patterns of action and interaction for organizing their congruent processes. Our case is an international financial organization which has one of the first e-banks and largest user bases of these systems in the world. E-banking is one of the advanced strategic web application areas where there is already a long history of use by a high number of external, heterogeneous users. Hence, we believe that these results may be applicable to other web-based information systems as well.

This paper represents the first academic study of student satisfaction with a MOOC—this one experienced as part of an information systems class in an MBA program. We developed a causal model based on the literature was and measured 1) student satisfaction with the learning experience and 2) students’ desire to take more courses this way. Using structural equation modeling, the analysis indicated that content in terms of quality and course materials, along with the opportunity for college credit, were the dominant factors in satisfaction, which, in turn, influenced the desire for more courses. The paper ends with a call for action by university administrators to proactively manage this new technology rather than adopt a “wait and see” attitude.

%X There is a growing recognition among alignment researchers and IT professionals that "one size does not fit all."  In this article, we provide an important extension of alignment research that shows three profiles linking IT to different business objectives.  We address the need to identify the appropriate types of IT alignment by using a multi-method study including interviews and cases.  Two dimensions define the three alignment profiles: internal IT-business integration and external market engagement.  The technical resource profile calls for low levels of IT-business integration and IT-market engagement.  The business enabler profile deploys IT in some business processes and begins engaging IT with customers and suppliers.  The strategic weapon profile uses IT to mobilize and extend the enterprise, which requires extensive IT deployment, both internally and externally.  Each profile differs in strategies, criteria, capabilities, and mental models.  Importantly, IT decision-makers should not adopt stage-model thinking which assumes that technical resource profiles naturally progress up the chain.  Rather, successful use of IT requires specifying the requisite alignment profile as an initial design decision so that appropriate levels of resource allocation and management involvement occur.

%X Procedural due diligence is critical for effective adoption and use of enterprise systems. Such procedural review needs to be holistic, capturing both the mechanistic aspects of process workflows as well as the human behavioral influences. Traditional methodologies offer little guidance on how to capture the human dimension of business processes. This article draws upon the Object Oriented (OO) concepts to propose and validate an approach that simultaneously models the content of the process flows and the human behavioral context. The two companies that served as test sites greatly benefited from using this process modeling approach. The analysis results gave these companies—that were on the verge of full-scale Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) implementation—reason to pause and reevaluate their current state of affairs.

%X Unlike technology users in business organizations, users of personal information technologies are usually not bound to specific products and have the freedom to switch from one product to a substitute. As a unique and widespread product level post-adoption behavior, IT user switching has not garnered sufficient attention in the current literature. Prior research has suggested that a consumer’s decision to switch follows careful reasoning on three distinct groups of factors: push, pull, and mooring. Given the highly routinized nature of post-adoption IT use, we draw from research on habit in social psychology and post-adoption user behavior literatures, and argue that users’ habit plays a critical role in post-adoption IT switching. Specifically, we posit that the habit of using the incumbent product both contributes to the mooring effects during the formation of intention to switch, and moderates the relationship between intention and switching. We tested our hypotheses on a sample of 414 users presented with a choice of switching their Web browsers. Our findings confirm the direct influence of potential switchers’ habit on switching intention, and the interaction between habit and switching intention on switching. Our overall model explains 55 percent of total variance in users’ intention to switch and 23 percent of total variance in user switching. This study advances the theoretical and empirical understanding of post-adoption technology switching, valuable to both researchers and practitioners.

%X Deception in applicant résumés is a major business problem. With the rapid growth of Internet job websites and computer-mediated communication, organizations are more at risk than ever before. Researchers have tried to improve individuals' deception detection accuracy to minimize the impact of deception, including warning individuals about deception and training individuals to detect deception. However, evidence was found that trained and warned individuals might make more incorrect judgments about true information, which are known as false alarms.  Further, few previous studies focused on the computer-mediated settings that are now a central part of business communication.  After conducting an experiment to understand these and other causes of false alarms in computer-mediated interview settings, we found that individuals performing interviews over an audio-based communication channel incorrectly judged interviewees as being deceptive more often than did individuals performing interviews via e-mail.  We found that while the number of lies detected was low for both types of communication, individuals communicating over an audio-based channel had more false alarms.  We also found that the combination of in-advance training and a just-in-time warning did not affect receivers' judgments about deception in our computer-mediated interview setting.

The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) initiated and sponsored a number of RFID trials between 2003 and 2006. METI selected the Japanese publishing industry, one of the largest publishing industries in the world, for an early item-level RFID trial geared to increasing industry profitability. This paper uses case study methodology to examine the 2006 METI RFID trial in the Japanese publishing industry. It reports on the trial results and on their implications. The study derives some insights concerning trial composition and the feasibility and efficiency of item-level RFID from the sub-trials. Setting the 2006 METI RFID trial into a broader perspective, the paper concludes with a summary, some lessons learned, and an outlook on future research.

%X A common thread in recent discussions of organisational change is the importance of the role allocated to information technology in the realisation of such change.  It is a feature of many of these discussions that IT is handled in a somewhat simplistic fashion, often with a pronounced theoretical leaning resulting in "the case of the disappearing technology". Even empirical studies of new technology often fail to pay attention to the actual details of technology in use, instead focusing upon the part technology might play in producing certain managerial or workplace configurations that are themselves theoretical renderings of organisational life.     By way of contrast, this paper presents some results from a long-term empirical investigation of computer systems in use in financial services that specifically aims to focus upon the actual details of technology in use.  In addition it attempts to address conventional concerns with the relationship between new technology and 'skill', productivity and other factors  in a rather different fashion by focusing on the issue of 'legacy'. We present a number of examples of legacy issues and try to delineate their impact on everyday working life. 'Legacy', we argue, is not just a problem encountered by organisations with aging mainframes and dated software, it is an issue from the moment a computer system becomes an integral part of any organisation's everyday work.

%X Legacy information systems evolved incrementally in response to changes in business strategy and information technology.  Organizations are now being forced to change much more radically and quickly than previously and this change places new demands on information systems. Legacy information systems are usually considered from a technical perspective, addressing issues such as age, complexity, maintainability, design and technology.  We wish to demonstrate that the business dimension to legacy information systems, represented by the organisation structure, business processes and procedures that are bound up in the design and operation of the existing IT systems, is also significant.  This paper identifies the important role of legacy information systems in the formation of new strategies.  We show that the move away from a stable to an unstable business environment accelerates the rate of change.  Furthermore, the gap between what the legacy information systems can deliver and the strategic vision of the organization widens when the legacy information systems are unable to adapt to meet the new requirements.  An analysis of fifteen case studies provides evidence that legacy information systems include business and technical dimensions and that the systems can present problems when there is a misalignment between the strategic vision of the business, the IT legacy and the old business model embodied in the legacy.

%X The World Wide Web has become a vital supplier of information for organizations in order to carry on such tasks as business intelligence, security monitoring, and risk assessments. By utilizing the task-technology fit (TTF) theory, we investigate the issue of when open-domain question-answering (QA) technology would potentially be superior to general-purpose Web search engines. Specifically, we argue theoretically and back up our arguments with a user study that the presence of fusion (information synthesis) is crucial to warrant the use of QA. At the same time, many information seeking tasks do not require fusion and, thus, are adequately served by traditional keyword search portals (Google, MSN, Yahoo, etc.). This explains why prior attempts to demonstrate the value of QA empirically were unsuccessful. We also discuss methodological challenges to any empirical investigation of QA and present several solutions to those challenges, validated with our user study. In order to carry our study, we created a novel prototype by following the Design Science guidelines. Our prototype is the first of its kind and is capable of answering list questions, such as What companies own low orbit satellites? or In which cities have illegal methyl-methionine labs been found? This investigation is only a precursor to a full-scale empirical study, but it serves as a medium to overview the state of the art QA technologies and to introduce important theoretical and empirical concepts involved. Although we did not find empirical evidence that one technology is uniformly better than the other, we discovered that once the user accumulates experience using QA, he/she can make an intelligent decision whether to use it for a particular task, which leads to the user to be more productive on average with the same tasks compared to when there is no choice of technology.

%X Organizations increasingly rely on complex information systems (IS) to preserve and enhance competitive advantage. Prior work has shown that these IS are often underutilized, prompting researchers and practitioners to seek out better explanations to account for IS use behaviors. Coping theory has recently emerged as a promising foundation for understanding users’ post-adoptive reactions to IS. This paper takes a first step toward integrating theories of IS adoption and use with coping theory by examining how adoption-related IS perceptions influence individual-level post-adoptive IS appraisal. Survey data collected from IS users at a university health center indicate that performance and effort expectancies surrounding use of the IS strongly influence primary IS appraisal (judgments of what is at stake as a result of the IS), while the presence of facilitating conditions relates to secondary IS appraisal (judgments of what can be done in response to the IS).

%X Persuasive technologies pervade much of our everyday lives today in areas from marketing to public health. In the latter case, persuasive technology represents a promising area of application. However, we know much too little about how to design effective interventions to support sustained behaviour change and improved well-being. The purpose of the present paper was to contribute in two ways. First, we want to contribute to current practice in designing such interventions. Second, we try to identify key research questions that could be a point of departure for a more detailed and comprehensive future research program. We do this by means of expressing 28 propositions. In sum, the propositions reflect that the construction of digital interventions should be seen as an iterative process which should take into account both content and design factors. However, we argue that intervention research and practical design experience is not just something that follows basic research at a polite distance, but rather is its inherent complement.

Its particular philosophic context is couched in strongly post-positivist assumptions such as idiographic and interpretive research ideals.  Action research has developed a history within information systems that can be explicitly linked to early work by Lewin and the Tavistock Institute.  Action research varies in form, and responds to particular problem domains.  The most typical form is a participatory method based on a five-step model, which is exemplified by published IS research.

Frequently categorized as technologies of play, synthetic worlds range from massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) such as World of Warcraft, to virtual reality environments such as Second Life. Increasingly, educators, researchers and corporations are recognizing these 3D online spaces as legitimate communication media, thereby blurring the lines between work and play, and between reality and virtuality. In this panel, presented at the 2007 International Conference on Information Systems, we explore how the fluid work-play and reality-virtuality boundaries are negotiated and managed in practice. The panelists will rely on their research, conducted in educational, corporate and game environments, to address questions about learning, working and playing in these new media spaces.

Online sellers have also experimented with buyer-determined pricing schemes, such as the “Pay What You Want” model that is the focus of this study. Under this pricing scheme, buyers are allowed absolute control over the price of the transaction, including the amount of zero if desired. Using Social Exchange Theory as a guide, we explored the possibility that a buyer’s price he or she is willing to pay and the price actually paid for a digital product on the iTunes marketplace can differ based on social and economic factors associated with the transaction. While this study offers an exploratory look into the PWYW model in an online setting, the results provide insight for product developers and marketers considering this pricing scheme.

%X Social computing, enabled by the Internet and peer-to-peer computing (P2P),  is a force to be reckoned with. Today, most observers believe that the changes we’ve seen in some industries, like entertainment, is just the tip of a huge iceberg that is going to hit many different sectors. The power of social computing to disrupt the traditional business-to-customer relationship is merely one of several changes we are beginning to see in organizations. Social computing also facilitates new ways of working, learning and collaboration, which are foreign to more conventional practices but which have considerable strategic potential if they are effectively managed. Yet currently, organizations in general do not appreciate its value and strategic potential.
%X Social computing’s promise is that technology will fit more naturally into our lives because it will adapt more readily to our locations, preferences and schedules. The challenge for organizations is to understand how to use it effectively to deliver new forms of business value.  It’s easy to dismiss social computing as “just another technology fad” and most companies are approaching it very cautiously. The reality is that social computing is already a factor in organizations today even though we are still early in its evolution.

%X The use of mobile Web browsing services is a worldwide phenomenon. The intent of this research is to produce a testable model of Web browsing services use that both identifies unique national market differences and yet is theoretically parsimonious enough to permit future cross-national studies. Specifically, our model examines which factors determine the use of mobile Web browsing services in South Korea. We show that content quality, hardware quality, ubiquity, cost, and relational factors are important predictors of actual use of mobile Web browsing services. However, counter to our model’s predictions, network quality and security did not appear to be significant factors in Korea at this point of market maturity. Future empirical examination of the proposed model in different markets worldwide should provide multinational IT vendors with better understanding of the similarities and differences in the global smart phone business.

%X In an attempt to provide an on-line payment mechanism for large-dollar cross-border transactions, TradeCard Inc. developed the world's first and only "credit card" for international trade. This case study discusses the major issues surrounding the viability of such a B2B electronic payment architecture. How would TradeCard provide a seamless and secure on-line settlement transaction? Is its platform capable of synchronizing all the databases involved in international transactions yet allowing all companies to use their own tools, operating systems and hardware platforms? How would TradeCard aggregate the disparate services offered by the network of companies involved in international trade? Would it change the mindset of global traders so that they would use its services rather than the traditional off-line settlement methods? The case discusses the critical issues involved in creating an international electronic payment system for cross-border transactions; the impact of new on-line alternative payment mechanisms on international trade payment environment; the systems security requirements for safe electronic payments for B2B e-commerce; and TradeCard's business plan and marketing strategy in building a global e-commerce trading system.

%X For the information systems discipline, it is important to have means for assessing the performance exhibited by individual faculty members, groups of researchers, and the journals that publish their work. Such assessments affect the outcomes of university decisions about these individuals, groups, and journals. Various kinds of data can be used in the processes that lead to the decisions about performance. In this paper we consider one type of data that seems to be increasingly adopted, either explicitly or implicitly, as an indicator of performance: the journal impact factor (JIF), which is periodically reported in the Journal Citation Reports (JCR). The allure of JIFs for rating performance is that they come from a third party source (Thomson Reuters), are systematically determined in a largely transparent fashion, and yield a single number for each journal that is covered in the JCR. However, behind this allure several issues give us pause when it comes to interpreting or applying JIFs in the context of deciding on performance ratings. It appears that these issues are rarely understood or pondered by those in the information systems world who adopt JIFs for such decisions – at least not in an overt way. We examine these issues to understand the advisability of employing JIFs to produce performance ratings, the underlying assumptions, and the consequences. We conclude that use of JIFs in university decision making should be undertaken only with great caution, alternative decision inputs should be considered, and that judging the impact of a specific article by the journal in which it appears is questionable.

%X Information markets are mechanisms that allow a group of geographically dispersed participants to reach and continuously reevaluate consensus by discovering the value of alternative outcomes.  Evidence suggests that these markets can produce better quality decisions than a small subset of selected decision makers: a finding in direct opposition to the trust we place on expertise.  In challenging and uncertain decision-making arenas, information markets offer an interesting, and somewhat counter-intuitive approach.  In practice, information markets may be used in combination with other decision-making methods, but these market-based mechanisms offer many advantages.  This paper presents an information market typology and explores some of the challenges raised by different market applications.  Market types include event and estimation-based prediction markets, decision markets, and idea markets.  An integrated research landscape model and research propositions are presented to help guide continuing research in this area.

%X An academic course presents an opportunity for all participants to collaborate for improving their knowledge.  This collective improvement of knowledge is typically documented via material provided by the instructor and notes and assignments prepared by students.  Over the course of a semester, these materials provide not only the collective knowledge in that course, but also provide a chronological history of how the knowledge base evolved. The focus of this study is wiki collaboration in teaching & learning contexts.   A wiki is a medium in which a group of individuals can work together asynchronously on an idea and easily capture the essence in a reusable format.  Technically, a wiki is a collection of hyperlinked Web pages that are assembled with wiki software.   With wikis, the line between reader and contributor is intentionally blurred.  Further, wiki use reflects the view of an instructor as one who facilitates information sharing among learners rather than simply transmitting knowledge from themselves to their students.    Our initial motivation to explore the usefulness of wikis for teaching and learning was driven by the fact that wikis provide a medium in which several individuals could asynchronously work together on an idea and easily capture the essence in a reusable format.   We found that: (1) Wikis can be can be used for a variety of tasks ranging from signup sheet for students to self organize, to undertaking business analyses, to analyzing policy positions; (2) Instructor support and facilitation is key; and (3) Ease-of-use issues are present but do not preclude success.

In this research, we use two annual (2002 and 2008) cohorts of demographically representative national random samples to investigate the relative levels of digital divide along the typical socio-economic fault lines. We find from our statistical analyses that not only does a deep digital divide still persist along key dimensions (like education) of the socio-economic fault lines, it has in fact widened along several key dimensions (like income and urban-rural divide).

%X The fast-paced development of e-commerce caused many people in business to overlook key aspects of the relevant design principles for e-commerce systems. E-commerce applications that are currently being implemented and used are not necessarily the best and the most efficient that people can design and build.  The result is an opportunity for e-commerce design science researchers to make significant contributions and for business schools to create and maintain a strong e-commerce design science group of researchers.  However, fulfilling this need is often difficult for business schools because  resources and design science researchers are both scarce.  Partnering with the computer science school within the same university to set up an e-commerce research center that focuses on design science research may be a feasible alternative.

%X Academic and popular literature suggest that one plausible explanation for declining enrollments in the Information Systems (IS) discipline is the negative stereotypical image students have about IS professionals and the profession. However, there is a lack of empirical research that investigates the image of IS professionals. This study addresses this research gap. First, an instrument was developed to measure stereotypes of IS professionals. A series of empirical analysis was conducted to establish the measure’s psychometric properties. The findings revealed a five-factor, 15-item instrument that measured IS stereotypes in terms of geeks, gender, intelligence, managerial and technical dimensions. Then, the presence of stereotypes along each of these dimensions was examined. The literature has generally assumed that IS professionals are viewed as geeks, mostly male, intelligent, technically oriented, and lacking managerial skills. The study uncovered that strong stereotypes do exist along these dimensions. However, interestingly, most of the stereotypes were found to be in the opposite direction than the literature suggested. Students disagreed that IS professionals were geeks, that the IS profession was typically dominated by men, and that IS professionals were too technically oriented. They agreed that IS professionals possessed good managerial skills and were intelligent. The paper concludes with implications for theory and practice.

%X Design forms one critical paradigmatic view that pervades organizational studies, management, and information systems research. Building on the discussions in the first Working Conference on Designing Information and Organizations with a Positive Lens, we chart the potential contribution of positive design to the shaping of organizations, work processes, artifacts, communication networks, and information technologies. The figure of speech "Design with a Positive Lens," or in short "Positive Design," connotes here a distinctive perspective on design that is less focused on the detection of errors associated with gaining control and more concerned with human-centered design associated with the shaping of hopeful organizations and a thriving future. The paper examines how positive design can contribute to the design of information systems and organizations as related to five broad-scale areas: design of high performance work processes; positive design methods and techniques; cooperation and collaboration across boundaries to promote positive change; positive organizational design; and design science and practice. In this paper we aspire to promote the emerging cross-disciplinary discourse between scholars and designers that will foster positive organizational and technological design.

%X Until recently, one-to-one marketing, the ability to sell targeted goods to an individual based on their known or perceived needs, was not possible for most product types on a mass basis..  Indeed, marketing practice in recent years centered around segmented marketing, in which people are treated as members of groups with similar interests and marketing is done at the group level.  However, recent advances in information technology, including the Internet and its World Wide Web, database management systems, computer graphics, and electronic mail, as well as increased processor speeds, now permit one-to-one marketing on a mass basis over the Web.  This tutorial explains the concept of one-to-one marketing, including how companies can aspire to move in this direction.  It outlines a set of one-to-one marketing practices on the Web and explain how advances in information technology made these practices possible.

Thus, in addition to their technical skills, they must master the necessary management skills to lead and control software development projects.  The purpose of this tutorial is to present the fundamental concepts of modern project management and show how these concepts can be applied to software development projects. The tutorial presents a broad overview of current software project management practices that evolved over the years from a variety of complex projects. The subject is presented from the manager's rather than from the developer's perspective. The focus is on large and complex projects because these projects are the most challenging and in need of an effective project management discipline.

%X Systems implementation is an important topic, and numerous studies have been conducted to identify determinants of success. Among organizational factors that can have an impact on success, top management support and training are two of the most extensively studied variables. While the positive influence of both of these organizational factors is generally recognized, not all empirical evidence is supportive. Some researchers attribute the inconsistent findings to moderators such as task interdependence. Other researchers contend that the wide-ranging correlations observed in different studies are caused by nothing but statistical artifacts. Still another reason for the inconsistent results could be how the two variables are modeled. I meta-analyzed thirty prior studies that examine the effect of both top management support and training. The results support both independent variables having a moderate positive effect on implementation success. Additionally, they suggest that the most plausible model is one where training partially mediates the effect of top management support. Finally, the preponderance of evidence indicates that task interdependence does not moderate the effect of either top management support or training. Instead, the role of task interdependence is similar to that of top management support and training: as an independent variable with a direct effect on implementation success.

%X Preparing students to work in teams benefits learning experiences and provides a stronger foundation for the challenges of the workplace. Team-based learning (TBL) is an instructional strategy where small groups become closely coupled teams through repeated face-to-face collaboration on various projects and assignments. This paper illustrates how traditional team-based learning can be extended to the online environment. Different techniques are discussed based on the use of computer-mediated tools in hybrid (a mix of face-to-face and distance learning) and in completely virtual settings (without face-to-face interactions). Based on experiences gained through implementations of TBL in various courses, this article presents implementation options as well as the challenges of team learning in various environments.

Driven by the wishes of CDOT’s executive director, and in a response to aging information systems, CDOT decided to install an Enterprise Resource Planning System (ERP).  The case focuses on Bill Cron, an employee in the CDOT ITO, who was very concerned about not only the need for an expensive ERP, but also about the way the project was being executed.  He voiced his concerns using as many channels as he could identify, but they seemed to fall on deaf ears.  The decision focus of the case concerns which of three options Bill should pursue:  being quiet and falling in line as directed, continuing to voice his concerns internally (internal whistle blowing), or going public and divulging his concerns in the local press (external whistle blowing).

%X Despite being more meaningful and accurate to consider student technology use motivations as a set of interactive needs and expectations, the possible underlying hierarchical relationships among motivations receive little attention. Drawn from Uses and Gratifications (U&G) approach and from Means-End Chain (MEC) theory, this study investigates how student technology use motivations can be represented as a set of interrelated and hierarchically organized elements. A set of relevant data concerning students’ technology use motivations was collected by the Repertory Grid Interview Technique (RGT) and analyzed qualitatively using content analysis. Eleven identified student technology use motivations were structured by adopting interpretive structure modeling (ISM) technique. By using Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC) technique, eleven identified factors were further classified into three different types of variables: means, consequences, and ends. The findings of this study have significant theoretical and practical implications to both researchers and managers.

%X Conceptual models play an increasingly important role for business process engineering, information systems development, and customizing of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. Despite the widespread interest in conceptual modeling, relatively little is known to date on the level and nature of conceptual modeling use in practice. Therefore our study investigates how practitioners use conceptual modeling. In particular, we address the following three key questions: To what extent do practitioners use conceptual modeling techniques and tools? How relevant is conceptual modeling for certain purposes? Are there barriers and success factors in using conceptual modeling? This paper informs information systems professionals about recent trends in the area of conceptual modeling. The results of our study should be considered when developing syllabuses for modeling courses as well as when judging the relevance of various research streams in the area of conceptual modeling.

The panelists included information systems faculty members from the United States and Mexico. The covered topics included wireless fundamentals, wireless technologies, applications and value chain evolution, wearable computing, wireless mobile issues including privacy and security, issues of worldwide mobile services and trends, and social implications. The panelists believe that there has been a virtual explosion in the ubiquitous and embedded computing industry over the past decade. Computing technology is moving beyond personal computers and is progressing into devices with embedded technology. The trend of mobile wireless technologies is moving to one single device rather than multiple devices. A single device could contain any or all of the following components, such as cellular phone, digital camera, video recording, MP3, mobile cellular TV services including digital multimedia broadcasting (DMB) and digital video broadcasting, handheld (DVB-H). Also, wearable computing such as watches, smart shirt and clothing, body sensors, and health monitoring devices are in the nascent stages. Wireless technology known as radio frequency identification (RFID) is used to identify objects, including living creatures. Various RFID applications including item tagging and electronic passports prompted valid loss of privacy concerns and triggered intense and sometimes irrational public discussion.

%X Agile methodologies are changing the way we develop software.  Their emphasis on team-oriented development, joint code ownership, and reliance on people rather than predefined processes to guide activities, is transforming software development into a socio-technical process.  As methodologies become increasingly more people and team-oriented, there is an urgent need to investigate the personality profiles of software developers and their likely impact on the productivity of the development team.  A review of the IS research literature on personality studies found Jungian typology operationalized as Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to be the most popular approach for assessing personality profiles.  We compared the Five Factor Model (FFM) of personality, which is currently gaining popularity among personality psychologists, with MBTI.  Our analysis, based on extant research literature in personality psychology and group behavior, suggests that FFM not only provides better measures for all factors that are measured by MBTI, but it also allows us to assess Neuroticism, an important personality trait that is of interest to researchers studying work groups, such as the agile development team.  Our finding has important implications for researchers studying the agile development process.  It is also highly relevant to studies investigating the personality profiles of IS professionals.  Thus, our study attempts to bring in fresh insights from Personality Psychology, our reference discipline, to enrich IS research.

%X Virtual organizations are flexible organizations, dynamically built from components of existing organizations. There are many advantages to virtual organizations, yet they are rare because successful implementation of such a dynamic design requires a significant technology infrastructure and a complex organizational architecture. This article takes a design approach and proposes such a technology infrastructure based on electronic services, formal semantics, and multi-dimensional ontologies. Organizational components are formally described as services, and placed in multi-dimensional ontologies, not only to capture their structural components, but also their organizational goals and audiences. Such multi-dimensional ontologies are not only useful to describe and search for organizational components, but also to efficiently build larger components from existing units. The architecture is extended to include virtual communities, virtual transactions, and virtual social institutions. The impact of such an architecture on transaction efficiency, organizational flexibility and adaptation, power structure, individual privacy, and organizational dissent are discussed.

%X As we enter the 21st Century, we are confronted by waves of new technology and pressured by competitive forces to find the most effective and efficient uses of information systems (IS)in organizations. Periodically, it is useful to stand back and take a look at the IS field from a variety of perspectives.  These perspectives create "images" of IS that offer the potential of generating new insights into the field as it moves forward.  These "images" are created through the lens of metaphors. Metaphors have been used in IS to help explain many of its central concepts from systems development methodologies to human-computer interaction.  This paper describes five metaphors for the field of IS itself.  From these metaphors a set of challenges for IS researchers and practitioners is proposed.

We need to be more relevant to meet the increasing needs of our students, the organizations that hire them, and the larger society. To analyze the issues, I develop three different scenarios of where the IS field could be 10 years from now. The following visions of the future identify the implications of different levels of adaptation to relevance-related environmental pressures. Scenario 1: Minimal Adaptation. The IS field is shrinking, largely due to competition from newly established schools of information technology. The traditional paper-based journals continue to dominate. Their slow publication cycles, in contrast to the rapid rate of change in the IT industries, mean that most technical topics and many current managerial issues are excluded from the research that generates the greatest institutional rewards. However a market analysis indicates that we can still do relevant research in categories such as: 1) issues contrary to commercial interests; 2) unsolved problems; 3) issues economically unattractive to commercial researchers; 4) issues where management aspects are more important than technical aspects; and 5) research on teaching IS. Scenario 2: Moderate Adaptation. The IS field is approximately the same size, even though demand for graduates with IT skills is greater. The journals expand the subset of topics in which IS researchers can generate relevant contributions, by improving publishing cycle times. Adaptive responses include: 1) increasing electronic access to journal contents; 2) reducing review cycle times; 3) involving practitioners in reviews; and 4) revising norms for style and tone. Scenario 3: High Adaptation. The IS field is larger than before, growing in proportion to the demand for graduates with IT skills. Academia is facing tremendous pressures, many of which are driven or influenced by IT developments. These developments enable changes in the IS field such as: 1) including technical competence in evaluation criteria; 2) rewarding publishing in practitioner-oriented outlets; and 3) involving practitioners in substantive IS program issues. Scenario 1 is the "do nothing" alternative. Scenarios 2 and 3 represent substantial improvements, but they will not occur unless we act vigorously to improve our position.

%X The Chinese telecommunications industry has attracted considerable interest in recent years. Much of this interest has, however, focused on issues such as the growth of the industry, its structure or how it is regulated. The anti-competitive behavior of incumbents, however, has largely been overlooked. This article addresses this oversight by focusing on the incumbents’ suspected anti-competitive behaviors within the Chinese broadband tele-communications market. In doing so, the key role of the June 2001 Circular in shaping operator behaviors within the broadband telecommunications market is highlighted. From the analysis it is clear that the incentive of anti-competitive behaviors exists in the Chinese broadband market structure that was created through restructuring and June 2001 Circular, and that anti-competitive strategic behaviors of the incumbents are suspected to have occurred. The Chinese government does not have at its disposal, or has not implemented, measures to counter or deter this type of behavior.

%X Despite both the slow diffusion of information technology (IT) throughout health organizations and the high cost of implementation, organizations must focus on key strategic applications that deliver high quality care at lower costs. Identifying the strategic applications that support important healthcare processes is challenging. In this article we propose a framework for developing this high level perspective of strategic health information technology (HIT) applications. We then classify into the components of the framework numerous HIT applications and initiatives reported in the media.  Based on an existing framework, we identify two critical dimensions that capture two important characteristics of a healthcare delivery process, namely, the degree of mediation and the degree of collaboration. A healthcare process with a high degree of mediation involves a large series of activities in a sequential manner. Processes with a low degree of mediation “understand” that most participants in care delivery contribute directly, often simultaneously, to the final result. The underlying principle for this dimension is the level of functionality of the application. The degree of collaboration refers to the extent to which information is exchanged among the participants in a process. Depending on the degree of exchange, one can identify processes as having higher or lower degrees of collaboration. The underlying principle for this dimension is the degree of interoperability among the applications.  Strategic HIT applications lie on a continuum path from a low-high degree of mediation to a low-high degree of collaboration. Our examples show that healthcare delivery organizations evolve their HIT from ad-hoc isolated systems to interoperable, integrated digital health systems. The strategic framework provides a high level perspective of HIT while assisting in the evaluation of potential HIT candidates for implementation.

%X To manage organisational change in the context of legacy information systems, which may need replacement or revision, the strategy process should respond to corporate opportunity rather than past internal difficulties. Steering groups are often used to guide the strategy process. An important problem is the identification of appropriate stakeholders that need to be represented on the steering group. A related problem is to establish the boundary of the new information system. Computer Information Systems development often focuses on direct users and affected internal departments as the exclusive stakeholders. However these groups may present too narrow a perspective. To improve the effectiveness of the development process, a wider constituency should be considered that includes organisational partners in the wider business environment.  This paper presents a method, the stakeholder web, that identifies appropriate stakeholders and their viewpoints. It illustrates the concepts with a large-scale university information systems project. The stakeholder web is used to analyse the relationships between the activities and membership of a university information systems steering group over a five-year period. The results demonstrate the dynamic nature of the project and the associated changes in membership of the steering group.

%X A growing number of information technology systems and services are being developed to change users’ attitudes or behavior or both. Despite the fact that attitudinal theories from social psychology have been quite extensively applied to the study of user intentions and behavior, these theories have been developed for predicting user acceptance of the information technology rather than for providing systematic analysis and design methods for developing persuasive software solutions. This article is conceptual and theory-creating by its nature, suggesting a framework for Persuasive Systems Design (PSD). It discusses the process of designing and evaluating persuasive systems and describes what kind of content and software functionality may be found in the final product. It also highlights seven underlying postulates behind persuasive systems and ways to analyze the persuasion context (the intent, the event, and the strategy). The article further lists 28 design principles for persuasive system content and functionality, describing example software requirements and implementations. Some of the design principles are novel. Moreover, a new categorization of these principles is proposed, consisting of the primary task, dialogue, system credibility, and social support categories.

%X Global sourcing of software development has imposed new skill requirements on Information Technology (IT) personnel. In the U.S., this has resulted in a paradigm shift from technical to softer skills such as communications and virtual team management. Higher education institutions must, consequently, initiate innovative curriculum transformations to better prepare students for these emerging workforce needs. This paper describes one such venture between MU, U.S.A. and MDI, India, wherein IT students at MU collaborated with Management Information Systems (MIS) students at MDI on an offshore software development project. The class environment replicated an offshore client/vendor relationship in a fully virtual setting while integrating communications and virtual team management with traditional IT project management principles. Course measures indicated that students benefited from this project, gained first-hand experience in the process of software offshoring, and learned skills critical for conduct of global business. For faculty considering such initiatives, we describe the design and administration of this class over two semesters, lessons learned from our engagement, and factors critical to success of such initiatives and those detrimental to their sustenance.

%X In this article, we apply transaction cost theory (TCT) and institutional theory to the realm of IS outsourcing.  TCT posits that firm's outsourcing governance is influenced by transaction cost factors, namely, bounded rationality, opportunism, and risk.  Institutional theory, on the other hand, has been advocated to explain non-choice behavior of organizations in the context of competitors, norms, and professional associations.  Although TCT has been used extensively in the extant literature to study outsourcing arrangements, we argue that as IS outsourcing practices propagate in organizational fields, TCT explanations will take a back seat to institutional explanations.  We appropriate the transaction cost framework to the IS outsourcing setting and consider when and how firm's decision to adopt outsourcing and corresponding ex-ante screening and ex-post monitoring of the vendor will be influenced by mimetic, normative, and coercive institutional pressures.  More specifically, we argue that greater the density and rate of adoption in outsourcing during innovation diffusion and stability stages, the greater the possibility that transaction cost factors will be replaced by institutional factors in explaining firms' governance structures (decision to adopt outsourcing, and corresponding screening and monitoring).  Conversely, we posit that when the institutional pressures are relatively weak, TCT better explains the intricacies of IS outsourcing arrangements.  In conclusion, future research directions and managerial implications of the institutional environment on IS outsourcing governance are discussed.

%X The growing amount of crime, such as corporate frauds and virus attacks, in the last two decades highlights not only the importance of computer forensics in crime investigations but also the lack of forensic specialists in this area. An urgent need exists for universities to provide courses on computer forensics to ease the shortage of forensic specialists. This paper proposes a six-dimensional knowledge model for computer forensic courses. The six dimensions include categories of crime, computer technology, security, legislation, investigation process, and forensic tools. The paper describes in detail how the model was implemented in a postgraduate introductory computer forensic course. A brief summary of the lessons learned by the author in the course development and delivery is also presented.

%X Despite the vast amount of research conducted and knowledge accumulated to explain the adoption of electronic public services, the issue of how to design high quality e-government Web sites remains an unresolved and relatively understudied topic. This study aims to address this theoretical and pragmatic gap by differentiating service content from service delivery in prescribing technological solutions for enriching the service quality of e-government Web sites. Grounded in Ives and Learmonth’s [1984] Customer Service Lifecycle, this article explicates a series of functional specifications that may be superimposed onto basic government transactions to enhance the overall functionality of e-government Web sites. It also articulates six interface design principles that are pertinent to addressing citizens’ expectations associated with the delivery of public services via the Internet channel. Together, the resultant dimensions depict a comprehensive set of IT-enabled content functionalities and interface design principles that may direct future research into fully interactive and executable e-government services. Practitioners could also benefit from the utilization of these content and delivery dimensions both as a reflective mirror to isolate inadequacies in e-government Web site designs, and as a benchmarking mechanism to assess the level of maturity of existing public e-services as compared to other leading exemplars.

%X Evaluations of participant samples for experiments in information systems research often appear to be informal and intuitive. Appropriate participant choice becomes a more salient issue as the population of information technology professionals and users grows increasingly diverse, and the distribution of relevant characteristics in participant samples such as age, gender, nationality, and experience can often be unrepresentative of the characteristics’ distribution in target populations. In this paper, we present a framework based on widely accepted standards for evaluating participant choice and providing rationale that the choice is appropriate. Using a step-by-step approach, we compare current practice in experimental studies from top information systems journals to this framework. Based on this comparison, we recommend how to improve the treatment of participant choice when evaluating the validity of study inferences and how to discuss the tradeoffs involved in choosing participant samples.

%X The current shortage of qualified IT professionals in industry now extends to academia.  Academic departments need a systematic approach to recruit new IT faculty effectively.  This process is hindered not only by the shortage of formally qualified PhDs, but also by the lack of consensus in the definition of "IT" and the competition with industry for skilled professionals, even at the PhD level.  Another challenge is the gap between new PhDs seeking research positions and the shortage of qualified faculty in institutions for which teaching is a priority. This tutorial explores these and other issues related to IT faculty recruiting, and provides a systematic and practical methodology for pro-actively attracting the right people to the right places in academia.  An effective recruiting process requires thoughtful problem definition, identification of appropriate sources of alternatives, consistency and fairness in selection using well-defined criteria, and aggressive closure.

%X In today’s global competitive environment, organizations face a variety of challenges. Continuous improvement in organizational efficiencies and improving the entire supply chain are necessary to stay competitive. Many organizations are adopting radio frequency identification technologies (RFID) as part of their information supply chains. These technologies provide many benefits to the organizations that use them. However, how these technologies affect the consumer and their willingness to adopt the technology is often overlooked.
%X Many of these RFID tags remain active after the consumers purchase them. These RFID tags, placed in a product for one purpose and left in the product after the tags have served their purpose, are residual RFIDs. Residual RFID technology can have many positive and negative effects on consumers’ willingness to buy and use products containing RFID, and thus, on the business’s ability to sell products containing RFID. If consumers refuse to buy products with residual RFID tags in them, the business harm is greater than the business benefit, regardless of any gain in supply chain efficiency.
%X In this study, we outline some of the advantages and disadvantages of Residual RFID from the consumer perspective, then follow up with an in depth survey and analysis of consumer perceptions. Using structural equation modeling (SEM) we demonstrate that consumers’ perceptions of privacy risk likelihood and privacy risk harm negatively impact their intentions to use this technology. The implications of these findings need to be considered before the pending implementation of residual RFID technologies in the supply chain on a mass scale.

%X La plupart des travaux sur les processus de structuration ou d'appropriation des innovations dans les organisations laissent de côté le problème des dyschronies. Ils ne prennent pas en compte les différences dans la nature, le rythme et la temporalité des changements qui cohabitent au sein d'une même organisation. En réponse à cette limite, l'auteur propose ici un modèle basé sur la théorie de la pratique et sur l'approche néo-institutionnaliste afin de faire sens de la co-évolution des champs intra-organisationnels. Ce modèle, suggérant un processus d'équilibration entre des tensions institutionnelles, est construit à partir d'une étude longitudinale des différents champs de la communication de la Curie Romaine (l'administration centrale de l'Eglise Catholique installée au Vatican). Ces tensions concernent les domaines socio-techniques, socio-théologiques, socio-organisationnels et socio-économiques. Un ensemble de propositions est suggéré inductivement sur l'articulation entre celles-ci et les relations entre les champs intra-organisationnels (évolutions parallèles, convergentes ou compétitives).

%X As companies are increasingly exposed to information security threats, decision makers are permanently forced to pay attention to security issues. Information security risk management provides an approach for measuring the security through risk assessment, risk mitigation, and risk evaluation. Although a variety of approaches have been proposed, decision makers lack well-founded techniques that (1) show them what they are getting for their investment, (2) show them if their investment is efficient, and (3) do not demand in-depth knowledge of the IT security domain. This article defines a methodology for management decision makers that effectively addresses these problems. This work involves the conception, design, and implementation of the methodology into a software solution. The results from two qualitative case studies show the advantages of this methodology in comparison to established methodologies.

%X Trust, which has been found to be a significant facilitator for the adoption and usage of new business paradigms like e-commerce, is relatively unexplored in the context of e-government. Using trust literature as the theoretical lens, we propose an e-government trust grid for the adoption and usage of e-government, comprising two dimensions: ‘trust in government’ and ‘trust in Internet technology.’ Based on their levels of trust in the two identified dimensions, nations can fall into one of four quadrants: Adversarial, Competitive, Cooperative, and Collaborative. Using focus groups and interviews with young adults in Singapore, we find that in recent years, Singapore is evolving from the cooperative (low trust in Internet technology and high trust in government) to the collaborative (high trust in Internet technology and high trust in government) quadrant. The study delineates a set of lessons learned from the Singapore experience for engendering citizen trust in e-government. These lessons for governments are: solicit feedback from citizens, demonstrate top leadership commitment and support, build institutional trust, cultivate IT literacy, and enact comprehensive and effective legal systems.

In this case study, the frustration of a talented product designer for a U.S. leader in Smartphone technology leads to bigger questions about his firm’s willingness and ability to adopt a new IT-enabled innovation in product design and generative customization. He enlists the aid of an IT support analyst to help convince his organization to consider this new approach to extend and expand the company’s existing significant sales growth and market dominance in an increasingly competitive environment. The company must also understand the impact on product design of human cognitive creativity leveraged by an emerging technology, the viability of its closed system model of innovation, and the organizational challenges associated with market volatility and innovation.

This in turn calls for enterprise applications that are based on open standards, simple to implement, and easy to modify and upgrade. In response to these structural changes in the market and customer demands, and facing fierce competition in a saturated market, SAP had to rethink its strategic position. This case discusses how SAP transformed itself by turning its proprietary software products to an open development and integration platform so that customers could modify them to suit their specific needs. The implications of this new strategy for software industry as a whole are discussed.

%X Integration of technical systems with business processes, and coherent strategies for the development of both, have long been recognised as critical to the competitiveness of companies. However, as separate systems become integrated, dependencies are established that complicate future reengineering exercises. These internal dependencies increase the risk associated with change, promote incremental approaches to systems reengineering and hasten the emergence of legacy systems. Once established, these legacy systems not only represent an impediment to advancing the technology strategy, they may also lock in redundant business processes with a consequent erosion of competitiveness. Reengineering these legacy systems to improve competitiveness therefore requires both technical expertise in systems engineering and an understanding of what the business process is intended to achieve. Recent technical and business change drivers such as the 'Year 2000 Problem' (Y2K) and Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), however, exposed concerns that many organisations may lack even the required technical expertise. Clearly a demand for improving the capture and dissemination of systems reengineering expertise exists. One recent and promising approach to allowing transfer of expertise in well-defined contexts uses patterns. This paper explores patterns as a means of codifying and disseminating systems reengineering expertise. Through widening the definition of a legacy system to include the business process, we propose that patterns may provide a communication link between business and technology strategists that would help align their objectives and improve the sustainability of any resulting competitive advantage.

%X Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), including Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS) and Global Positioning Systems (GPS), are technologies that have evolved considerably in the past few years. They have the potential to provide a means by which organizations can follow employees in real time. However, this permanent surveillance may have unexpected impacts on employees as well as on the organization itself. We followed the systems development research process to build a hybrid RFID-GPS system that allowed for the real-time location of human resources both indoors and outdoors. We tested this system in the security service of a Canadian university and explored its impacts on the workgroup and its employees. Our findings suggest that this kind of system can work in a real-world context, and that it has distinct impacts on the individual and the organization of a type not usually observed with more traditional information systems.

%X People who have had the most impact on our lives are those who have seen some special trait or character in us and then nurture that special something. Gary Dickson has had that kind of impact on others. Gary also has left us with a discovery framework for survival in academia. Surviving academics must groom themselves for their careers through the use of knowledge that can be turned into action. Knowing yourself and your strengths and weaknesses, your field and its perception by other academics, key players both while in a Ph.D. program and in an academic position, success factors in the job market and on the road to tenure and promotion, your publication outlets, and how you personally react to criticism are all part of your desired "knowledge package." But, knowledge is not enough. You must use your information system and knowledge base along with an action plan to reach your goals. Actions including but not limited to a balance in life, turning unstructured tasks into structured ones, and thinking beyond system boundaries all can guide you to be a survivor in academia. This conversation among Gary Dickson's first Ph.D. student, a newly minted Ph.D. who Ken advised, and a current student of Ken's, provides food for thought on building your knowledge base and some guides to actions that will aid your academic career.

We frame our study within the wider context of the evolution of the industry in order to illustrate how the emerging business model of mobile application development shapes the everyday practices of systems developers, specifically those working on iPhone and Android platforms. Drawing on qualitative research carried out in Sweden, the UK, and the U.S., we analyze developers’ experiences in order to illustrate how they respond and adapt to the turbulent environment of the IT sector.

%X Due to several recent highly publicized information breaches, information security has gained a higher profile. Hence, it is reasonable to expect that information security  would receive an equally significant emphasis in the education of future systems professionals. A variety of security standards that various entities (e.g., NIST, COSO, ISACA-COBIT, ISO) have put forth emphasize the importance of information security from the very beginning of the system development lifecycle (SDLC) to avoid significant redesign in later phases. To determine the emphasis on security in typical  systems analysis and design (SA&D) courses, we examine (1) to what extent security is emphasized in the core SA&D courses and (2) at what phase in the SDLC do most SA&D courses begin to emphasize security. In order to address these questions, we reviewed SA&D textbooks currently on the market to identify how extensively they cover security-related issues. Given the fairly high awareness of information security in practice, we expected to see an equally high emphasis on such matters in the textbooks. However, our review suggests that this is not the case, which suggests a gap in our preparation. To address this gap, we offer a proposal for modifying a portion of the SA&D curricula.

%X This paper discusses two trends that threaten to undermine the effectiveness of online social marketing interventions: growing mistrust and competition. As a solution, this paper examines the relationships between Web site credibility, target audiences’ active trust and behaviour. Using structural equation modelling to evaluate two credibility models, this study concludes that Web site credibility is best considered a three-dimensional construct composed of expertise, trustworthiness and visual appeal, and that trust plays a partial mediating role between Web site credibility and behavioural impacts. The paper examines theoretical implications of conceptualizing Web sites according to a human credibility model, and factoring trust into Internet-based behavioural change interventions. Practical guidelines suggest ways to address these findings when planning online social marketing interventions.

%X Open source has democratized software innovation to an unprecedented degree, but doubts persist as to whether democratized innovation can extend to business applications, where individual developers are not the end users. We report on a new kind of ecosystem around extensions to open source business applications, and examine the types of contributors and contributions relative to previous open source research. Our results show a surprising presence of small businesses, particularly consultants and freelance developers. These smaller firms bridge an important gap between lead users and producers, contributing disproportionately to new back-end and integration features. This study shows how new networks of commercial and semi-commercial players, particularly small businesses, are combining their efforts to create viable business ecosystems around successful open source business applications.

%X This study employs 130 health care integrated delivery systems (IDSs) currently active in the U.S. to examine the quality and financial performance impacts of strategic fit for interorganizational networks.  Using secondary data from HIMSS Analytics and the American Hospital Directory, this study classifies the IDSs into High-Maturity Organizations and Low-Maturity Organizations based on the corresponding levels of IT integration and organizational maturity achieved at the time of the study.  A model of the relationship between strategic fit and both average length of hospital stay and operational cost is then tested for each group.  With comparisons across the two levels of IDS development, the results suggest that IDSs that have achieved both high IT integration and organizational maturity exhibit greater improvements to both average length of hospital stay and operational cost than do IDSs at a lower level of IT integration and organizational maturity.

This article offers survival skills in project management for the difficult existing business environment, particularly within information systems, of today.  The case study considers the tragic expeditions in 1996 to scale the peak of Mount Everest. Things went terribly wrong, ending in the deadliest tragedy in the history of the mountain.  The accounts of the survivors summarized within several books on the ordeal are used to consider the implications of project management issues that pervade such difficult projects  –  leadership styles, hubris, planning, communication, and constraints.  Readers of this case study should consider effectively implementing practices that could prove to be the difference in surviving an “Everest” project.

%X This article uses institutional theory as a basis to understand organizational processes that influence the extent to which web technologies that support the organization-customer relationship are adopted and subsequently diffused within an organization. The effect of coercive, mimetic, and normative processes that lead an organization to initially implement web technologies, referred to as adoption, differ from how those processes influence an organization to integrate evolving web technologies with business activities, referred to as diffusion. Adoption is presented as homogeneous across organizations and organizational populations, whereas diffusion is homogeneous within organizational populations. A theoretical model and related propositions are provided to guide future research.

%X Although scholars have provided advice regarding how to conceptualize multidimensional constructs, less attention has been directed on how to evaluate structural equation models that include multidimensional constructs. Further, the extant information systems literature has provided little, and sometimes contradictory, direction on how to operationalize multidimensional constructs. This gap in how we approach multidimensional constructs merits attention because: (1) establishing construct validity is critical to testing theory and (2) recent advances in software enable testing models with multidimensional constructs more readily. Therefore, this tutorial (1) describes different forms of multidimensional constructs and (2) illustrates how to integrate superordinate and aggregate multidimensional constructs in structural equation models. In doing so, we offer guidelines and examples for how to conduct and evaluate research using multidimensional constructs.

The aim of the panel discussion was to stimulate a meta-theoretical discussion about the relationship between the Humanities and Information Systems in a way opposite to the usual. A lot of research has been conducted on the application of computing in the Humanities, but this panel explored the reverse process of enrichment that takes place. The purpose was to give recognition to work that has already been done in this regard by means of identifying a substantial sub-discipline, but also to inspire more and deliberate research that explores ways to enhance Information Systems by interweaving insights and methods from the Humanities. Such an endeavor may enhance ICT to empower the communities using these technologies.

%X Self-citation is a common practice in the research community.  It includes citing one’s own papers and one’s target journal.  A recent action by a publisher requesting each author of its journal to cite at least five papers published by the journal calls for a study of the self-citation patterns in MIS journals.  This study intends to examine the cited table and the citing table in the database of Journal Citation Reports and identify the self-cited and self-citing patterns of MIS journals included in this database. Through a descriptive analysis, influential as well as problematic journals are identified and the implications for journal stakeholders are discussed.

%X You're reading an abstract of a research paper.  Is the abstract sufficiently relevant to make you want to read the whole paper? That's the question that we look at here.  We start with an assumption: If the abstract doesn't grab your attention, you will skip the paper and go on to read another.  To find out if our assumption is true, we asked two groups of people (a group of information systems professionals and a group that conducts research on information systems) to judge whether abstracts would entice them to read the article.   Unfortunately, we found little consensus in the literature about how best to measure the relevance of a paper or its abstract.  We therefore ran an experiment to improve our understanding. In this experiment we used three dimensions of relevance based on the work of Benbasat and Zmud (1999):  Important: the topic is important to the reader,  Accessible: the paper is written so that its ideas can be understood, and   Applicable: the reader can apply the paper his or her own work. Our question was: Do people use these dimensions to determine from the abstract whether or not the article is relevant enough for them to read all of it?  We created, validated, and ran a questionnaire to measure these three dimensions. We found that, for both practitioner and academic audiences, being important, accessible, and applicable are indeed significant indicators for reading an article based on its abstract.   Well, we've led you to the water, will you drink?

%X With the recent legislation providing financial incentives to physicians who acquire electronic health record systems, we will be afforded an opportunity to study incentivized adoption of technology coupled with the threat of future penalties for non-adoption. This research uses institutional theory to propose factors that are expected to influence the adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) by independent physician practices in the coming years. The study presents a model describing the role of coercive, mimetic, and normative forces on adoption intent. Payer incentives/penalties as well as dominant healthcare delivery partners will exert coercive pressures on physician practices. Additionally, since physicians identify with their own specialties, it is expected that they will also be subject to mimetic forces resulting from successful adoption by similar specialists, particularly given their concerns about expected benefits from these systems. Finally, normative forces resulting from the successful interoperation of electronic health records among regional providers should influence physician adoption. The ability to partner with other physicians and healthcare providers or vendors adopting the same system should increase individual practice adoption intent in the presence of coercive, mimetic, and/or normative forces.

%X With the promises of e-commerce come problems and opportunities for researchers and practitioners.   One of these opportunities is taking a design science approach to e-commerce research.   The argument is made that design science contributes to the theory in business school research.    Contributions of design science to the research and practice of e-commerce are categorized into artifacts that aid e-commerce practitioners, artifacts that aid e-commerce researchers, and theories related to these artifacts.   However, the design science approach introduces limitations such as the perishability of design science artifacts, and the time it takes to develop an artifact to the point where it is useful for practice.

%X EndNote is a program for managing bibliographic references that allows the user:  - to create a database of references (and extended abstracts) that can be queried in many ways  - to copy references directly into their favorite word processing program and to create a bibliography at the end of the paper  - to format a paper that includes in-text citations and a bibliography to meet the standards of a particular journal or publication - to change the format (style) of the citations and bibliography of a given paper at any time and as often as needed.  Commonly used styles are included with EndNote. The user can also download additional styles or design their own styles. References can be entered into the database manually one at a time, or copied automatically from already existing files or even from online sources. Copying is aided by the use of filters and connection specifications, many of which are included in the package. The user is also allowed to design new ones. While the program work best when used in conjunction with MS-Word or Corel-WordPerfect, it also works with several other file formats like Rich Text Format, FrameMaker MIF, ClarisWorks, and AMI Pro. Finally, EndNote can be used as a common interface to many online libraries and electronic databases. This paper presents a tutorial on EndNote for IS researchers and students. It assumes that the reader is familiar with the fundamental operations of the package and is interested in using the package at more than a rudimentary level. Notes for the beginner are included.

%X Because business-to-business (B2B) electronic marketplaces (e-marketplaces) facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers, they strive to foster a trustworthy trading environment with a variety of trust-building measures. However, little research has been undertaken to explore trust-building measures used in B2B e-marketplaces, or to determine to what extent these measures are applied in B2B e-marketplaces and how they are applied. Based on reviews of the scholarly, trade, and professional literature on trust in electronic commerce, we identified 11 trust-building measures used to create trust in B2B e-marketplaces. Zucker's trust production theory [1986] was applied to understand how these trust-building measures will enhance participants' trust in buyers and sellers in B2B e-marketplaces or in B2B e-marketplace providers. A descriptive content analysis of 100 B2B e-marketplaces was conducted to survey the current usage of the 11 trust-building measures. Many of the trust-building measures were found to be widely used in the B2B e-marketplaces. However, although they were proven to be effective in building trust-related beliefs in online business environments, several institutional-based trust-building measures, such as escrow services, insurance and third-party assurance seals, are not widely used in B2B e-marketplaces.

%X The debate between protagonists of different theoretical approaches continues in the IS field, with little prospect of resolution. The debate is typically characterized by tendentious arguments as advocates of each approach offer a one-sided condemnation of other approaches. Debate on the qualities of theoretical explanations of technological change is hampered by the shadow of supremacist strategies that is cast over the debate, illustrating the manner in which IS researchers are polarized into opposing camps, each viewing the other as inferior. Ironically further polarization is occurring in the ways that various groups of IS scholars are simultaneously calling for order, discipline and clearer notions of the “core of the discipline” while other scholars call for greater research diversity. In order to overcome this polarization we advocate a strategy recommended by Weick [1996]: Drop your tools—hold your concepts lightly and update them frequently. Three reasons for dropping our theoretical tools are put forward—the focus on improving practice, the focus on building cumulative tradition in the mother discipline, and the focus on building cumulative tradition in one’s own discipline—suggesting researchers must consider the “fit” between problem domain, theory and the relationship of the chosen theory to the method of inquiry.

To address the concern of lack of relevance, an IS relevance index was suggested in 2005 and used in an exploratory study using two years of conference review data. This paper reports on a 2007 panel presented at the Australasian Conference on Information Systems, which explored the idea of this IS relevance index and discussed openly the issue of lack of relevance in conducting, evaluating and presenting IS research. This paper first introduces the debate and the concept of an IS relevance index. Next, viewpoints of individual panel members are presented and finally the subsequent panel discussion is summarized.

%X The discipline of MIS has been going through extensive soul searching in recent years. Part of that soul searching deals with the question of whether we are teaching our students the right material considering the emerging apparent rift, caused in part by new technologies, between what the industry needs and what we teach. This article summarizes a panel on this topic held at the 32nd meeting of the International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS) in Shanghai 2011. The objective of the panel was to contrast what industry tells us they need and we do not give them, as presented by Gefen and Ragowsky based on several years of CIO roundtables and interviews, with a “balanced head” perspective presented by some of the most respected leaders in our field. The panel attracted an audience of approximately 160 attendees who took an active role in the discussion. Rather surprisingly, disagreements among the panelists were not as pronounced as might have been expected, and the audience mostly supported the antagonist position. We present this summary to our colleagues in MIS in the hope of eliciting a continued discussion on this crucial issue.

To foster the development of SIGs with the unique perspective only available from our discipline, AIS funded the first group of six SIG proposals. The funding is designed to provide seed money for the development of electronic resources such as web sites, listserves, and on-line discussion groups. In the long run, SIGs are expected to enhance their offerings with conference mini-tracks, newsletters, and directories. Some SIGs will offer workshops, calls for papers in special issues of journals, working papers, electronic bibliographies, tutorials, conferences, refereed journals, and pointers to research tools and industry contacts.

%X The year 2009 was a critical year in the development of Sanchari, a state-owned telecommunication infrastructure (TI) service provider in India. Over the past few years, Sanchari had successfully developed and delivered on-demand infrastructure services to customers in the state of Karnataka, India. Sanchari’s management team wanted to move their business up the value chain to take advantage of the rapidly growing telecommunication industry in India. In the middle of 2009, Sanchari was approached by the state government of Karnataka to lead the development of a state-wide-area-network (SWAN) under the e-government initiative. This e-government project could give Sanchari an opportunity to move up the value chain. Sanchari needed to decide whether it would take the sole responsibility of this project as the government agent or form a partnership with a private company to execute it. This decision, however, would depend on whether Sanchari wanted to develop into an infrastructure or software service provider or maintain its status quo as a TI service provider in the long term. The teaching case provides a challenging decision-making situation for students and urges them to analyze the benefits and risks of moving up the telecommunication value chain.

%X As global, virtual teams become more prevalent in the workplace, it is imperative that we, as educators, prepare IS students for this trend. Offshoring, virtual teams, and globalization are themes often discussed in the classroom, but students rarely experience these concepts. This paper is a case study of three globally distributed universities worked together on a project in order to equip students with knowledge and experience about these trends in an IS context. In spring 2008, students from a technical management course in the USA, a project development course in the USA, and a programming course in India worked in teams to propose, design, develop, and test software prototypes. The case study in this paper presents the three phases of this project: 1) planning, 2) execution, and 3) reflection. The planning phase includes the identification of teams, tasks, and technology. The execution phase includes challenges and successes that can be avoided or enhanced in future iterations. Finally, the reflection phase presents lessons learned from the student and instructor perspective as well as perceived value of the project across students, instructors, and industry representatives. In general, students perceived this project to be quite valuable for their future careers and successful as a learning experience, but the project was not without its challenges throughout.

%X This paper presents a methodology for socio-cognitive research based on the theory of social representations. Elements of the methodology include:1) data elicitation through free word association; 2) content analysis/coding to identify key concepts in the social representation; 3) analysis of the structure of the representation using analysis of similarity and core/periphery analysis; 4) correspondence analysis to place the concepts on a perceptual space; and 5) interpretation of the social representation. The methodology is demonstrated in use through a study examining early sense-making about electronic health records (EHRs). Analysis of qualitative survey data from 190 students identified 22 concepts forming the social representation. Merits of the methodology are discussed, including its potential value for investigations based on technology frames of reference (TFR), the social construction of technology (SCOT) and organizing visions for IT innovations.

%X Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a hot topic in retail supply chain management [Behrenbeck, Küpper et al. 2004]. Yet, a recent study predicts “that the true benefits of RFID for retailers will be in enhanced marketing opportunities” [Sharpless 2005]. Research on RFID for marketing purposes is still rare giving the opportunity for more specific research on how RFID will influence business to consumer (B2C) marketing and services [Curtin, Kauffman et al. 2005]. Apparel retailing will most likely be one of the first industries to adopt item level tagging and thus benefit from those new marketing opportunities [Chappell, Durdan et al. 2003; Kurt Salmon Associates 2005].
%X This paper investigates the opportunities of RFID to enhance B2C marketing of apparel retailers. The paper presents six out of 17 developed RFID applications that support relationship marketing of apparel retailers to better recruit, retain, and recover customers. The RFID applications are classified by the marketing goals they fulfill and the marketing phase they support. The authors describe the use of each RFID application exemplified, and evaluate the additional value for the customer company relationship as well as the feasibility for apparel retailers to implement the application into practice.

%X Although user acceptance of entertainment-oriented information systems (IS), which are called Hedonic IS (HIS), has drawn considerable attention in literature, our understanding of user acceptance of HIS is still limited. This article focuses on exploring the intrinsic motivations of HIS acceptance from a unique perspective. It proposes a hybrid HIS acceptance model that considers the unique characteristics of HIS and the multiple conceptual identities of an HIS user. The model integrates intrinsic motivation factors from Hedonic theory, Flow theory, and the PAD (Pleasure, Arousal, and Dominance) emotion model with the Technology Acceptance Model. The proposed hybrid HIS acceptance model has been empirically tested by a quantitative field survey. The results indicate that emotional responses, imaginal responses, and flow experience are three main predictors of HIS acceptance.

At the same time, Chinese businesses increasingly need to innovate with IT to create competitive difference and expand internationally. However, to what extent has China developed the capabilities to develop IT innovations and adopt them successfully? This 2011 ICIS panel session built a rich picture of maturity, skills, and management processes concerning IT adoption and innovation, bringing together diverse perspectives from research and practice. By drawing on experience from Europe and the U.S., as well as China itself, it also reflected on distinct aspects of the Chinese business environment and the impact of these on IT.

%X Competing values are a fact of organizational life. However, there are gaps in our understanding about how these opposing beliefs hinder influence processes. This article draws on interview data to demonstrate how Irish Chief Information Officers (CIOs) are able to convince their colleagues to support new projects within their firms in the face of competing values. Focused interviews were used to explore the influence process and the competing values phenomenon, since this type of research is at an early stage and qualitative methods and analysis serve as a rich source of theory development. The data showed that the CIOs who did not face competing values were able to successfully influence other executives to support proposed projects. Additionally, half of the remaining CIOs who did face competing values were also successful at influencing their colleagues. In these cases, several features of the situation existed, including (a) small relative project size, (b) projects that were consistent with both external and internal environmental conditions, (c) the use of upward influence, and (d) the right combination of influence behaviors. Finally, we suggest actions that CIOs can use to successfully influence other executives when faced with the challenge of competing values.

%X Over the last decade, online social networks have evolved into a global mainstream medium with increasing social, organizational, and economic impact. This paper provides a structured overview of Information Systems research on this outstanding techno-social phenomenon of the 21st century via a structured literature review. Based on our search in information systems journals and conference proceedings that resulted in 510 papers, we carve out and assess the knowledge and the research fields that have been predominantly addressed and impacted by the information systems research community so far. Moreover, we identify research gaps that future research should address. We analyze how the academic discussion on online social networks developed in the information systems literature over time, which publication outlets are most receptive to research on online social networks, which research areas have already been covered by information systems research on online social networks, and what potential future research areas exist that have not been covered by information systems research yet. We hope that our results will stimulate and guide future research in this field.

We investigated an online community of interest, the members of which voluntarily associate and communicate with people with similar interests.  Community members, posters and lurkers alike, were surveyed on the influence of extrinsic and intrinsic motivations, as well as normative influences, on their willingness to share information and rumors with others.  The results indicated that posters and lurkers are differently motivated by intrinsic factors to share, and that extrinsic rewards like improved reputation and status-building within the community are motivating factors for rumor mongering.  The results are discussed and future directions for this area of research are offered.

%X Citation rates are important criteria for judging an author’s impact in the research community or discipline. They form one of the many indicators of research quality that help people less familiar with a field understand the effectiveness of a research paper or individual. The contents of a bibliography or set of references are also markers that help orient the reader to the framework of a piece of writing. Lately, journal publishers have paid increased attention to citation rates as more and more journals vie to be included in abstracting and indexing services. These lists act as a filter for libraries and bulk subscription brokers, so they can affect circulation and hence, revenue. Because of this, some journals have required authors to cite prior papers from the same journal when submitting research, even going so far as to specify how many citations are needed for a paper to be considered. This paper argues that commercial considerations must not outweigh the primary academic purpose of a citation list. Not only are there a host of conventions associated with citations that arise from author integrity and community relationships, but the bibliography is itself research data for another discipline. Compelling and precise portraits of researchers can be derived from such data. A case from library science on the late Rob Kling’s sources illustrates the value of preserving the integrity of citations for the purpose of building and understanding a discipline, not a revenue stream.

%X The value added by an organization's IT assets is a critical concern to both research and practice.  Not surprisingly, a large number of IS effectiveness measures can be found in the IS literature. What is not clear in the literature is what measures are appropriate in a particular context.  In this paper we propose a two-dimensional matrix for classifying IS Effectiveness measures.  The first dimension is the type of system studied.  The second dimension is the stakeholder in whose interests the system is being evaluated.  The matrix was tested by using it to classify IS effectiveness measures from 186 empirical papers in three major IS journals for the last nine years. The results indicate that the classifications are meaningful.  Hence, the IS Effectiveness Matrix provides a useful guide for conceptualizing effectiveness measurement in IS research, and for choosing appropriate measures, both for research and practice.

%X An enrollment crisis continues to plague the Information Systems (IS) discipline. Although recent studies have begun to offer several potentially profitable strategies to reverse plummeting student enrollments, little evidence has been put forth to document comprehensive intervention initiatives aimed at attracting students in higher education institutions. To this end, this study describes a 12-step program targeted at the introductory IS course at one such institution. Developed based on empirical evidence from the literature, discussions with our IS colleagues, and best practices at other institutions, the 12-step program covers all aspects of the course including faculty assignment, tenor and approaches used in class, and innovative ways to tell the IS story. As a result of implementing the program, enrollments in core upper-division IS courses at the institution doubled. This paper presents a powerful, integrated program that is replicable and can be used by other IS departments to address the enrollment crisis at their institutions.

%X Research pertaining to emergency response systems has accelerated over the past few years, particularly since 9/11 events, and more recently due to Hurricane Katrina and concern of the avian flu pandemic.  This study examines the requirements that are the most demanding with respect to software and hardware, and the associated design strategies for a public health emergency response system (ERS) for electronic laboratory diagnostics consultation.  In addition, this study illustrates ways to evaluate the design decisions. An important goal of a public health ERS is to improve the communication and notification of life-threatening diseases and harmful agents. The system under study is called Secure Telecommunications Application Terminal Package or STATPack. STATPack supports distributed laboratories to communicate information and make decisions regarding biosecurity situations. The intent of the system is to help hospital laboratories enhance their preparedness for a bioterrorism event or other public health emergency. The practical nature of this research concerns how an ERS diagnostic and consultation system was designed to alert and support first responders and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). The academic nature of the research centers on the critical requirements of an ERS and how these unique needs can be met through careful design.  Understanding the critical requirements will assist developers to better meet the expectations of the users. Specifically, I conducted a thirteen month study analyzing the requirements, design, and implementation of the system.

%X By focusing on those companies that currently partner with Northeastern University’s College of Business Administration, this article provides an exploratory empirical study that examines employer expectations of undergraduate business school co-op students and graduates. My particular concern in this research is what IT competencies are valued by employers when evaluating students for initial co-op engagements and subsequent full-time employment assignments.  I then consider the bearing of these findings on MIS curricular design and the associated classroom experience.  Drawing upon a detailed survey of 111 employers of Northeastern University undergraduate business school students and subsequently on focus groups with representative employers from the study population, I have identified a clear pattern of current and anticipated expectations that suggest the need to rethink the current approach to classroom MIS content and delivery—both within MIS courses and throughout the typical business school curriculum.

%X Virtual learning environments have in recent years become an important tool in higher education, in distance learning as well as on campus. This study analyzes factors influencing acceptance of virtual learning environments among academic staff and students in blended learning environments. Two research questions guided the study: (1) How do organizational and individual factors influence the acceptance of virtual learning environments among academic staff and students? (2) What are the implications for practice in order to create good prerequisites for acceptance of virtual learning environments? The study was performed as a comparative, explanatory case study at three universities providing master education of public health in Sweden, Norway and Lithuania. The findings of the case study showed that the contextual factor of culture was powerful in influencing acceptance of virtual learning environments, positively as well as negatively. High degrees of performance expectancy, results demonstrability and social influence affected acceptance of virtual learning environments positively. The degree of social influence was hypothesized to be transferred by the contextual factor of culture. The organizational culture of universities, ex-pressed as shared values of what is good quality teaching and learning, were found to partly oppose values inherent in the virtual learning environment. Implications for practice are put forward, emphasizing culture as an important factor to consider in the implementation of virtual learning environments.

%X Inconsistent and incomplete information due to the diversity of isolated information systems is one of the major problems information technology faces in the healthcare sector. The insufficient integration of actors results in delays in clinical processes. However, due to strict constraints in health care such as health regulations, clinical processes cannot be modified freely. The approach of this work is to apply the less radical principles of Business Process Management to medical information systems to provide reliable and timely access to relevant patient information and to decrease process lead time. In particular, this work outlines the impact of optimization for administrative processes. To substantiate our research, we performed a case study in collaboration with a healthcare provider and a regional healthcare facility in the U.S. We report on the workflow implementation of a clinical infection control process which integrates disparate systems and automates clinical decision making according to clinical knowledge. The post-metrics clearly emphasize the capability of Business Process Management to improve the integration of information, increase the quality of patient care, reduce health worker's stress, and ease costs of treatment by significantly shortening process lead time. We conclude with a generalization of the results for other healthcare enterprises.

While emotions ran high in the ensuing online discussion, we try to provide an objective and informed analysis of the actual citation patterns of both top tier journals and non-top tier journals.  Results show that the practice of self-citation is fairly common among both types of journals.  Additional analyses showed that the preference for top-tier citations was more prevalent in top-tier journals than in non-top-tier journals.  Supported by the data, we provide several arguments for these practices.

%X Social tagging systems, such as del.icio.us, have helped users find and reuse information by sharing individuals’ structural knowledge, i.e., the knowledge of relationships among documents and concepts. Besides being an Internet phenomenon, social tagging can help organizations manage their intranet document repositories. The structural knowledge embedded in tags is flat, shallow, and often ambiguous however. We develop a theoretical model to argue for potential benefits of sharing deeper structural knowledge in an electronic document repository through personal document hierarchies. Based on the theoretical model, we design a “social hierarchies” system. Deployment and exploratory study confirm the benefits of sharing personal hierarchies in a collaborative knowledge work environment and suggest future research directions.

%X The author who sits on an editorial board received a request from that journal's publisher that articles which were submitted to them contain at least five references to that journal. The publisher stated that this request was common practice.  A simple three-question, yes/no survey on AISWorld yielded overwhelming consensus that this journal self-citation practice is neither common, nor appropriate, nor ethical.  The survey results are presented.  In addition, a large number of respondents sent messages discussing their responses. The 21 papers that follow this introductory article are the result of a request to expand responses into short articles for CAIS.  Many of the papers are based on solid analysis while others are detailed expositions of points of view. The papers are divided into four groups: analysis of impact factors (an important consideration), responses from editors, discussions of ethics, and analyses of related issues.  Based on the responses, this article argues that the request for journal self-citation is a form of “payola” (pay to play) that is ethically inappropriate. The article is also an example of using the “wisdom of crowds” (Surowiecki 2004) as an alternative way to understand phenomena.

%X We present eighteen examples of mission-critical spreadsheets used by diverse people and organizations for application software development, financial risk management, executive information systems, sales and marketing business processes, business operations, and complex analytics. We argue the spreadsheet is a Rapid Development Language, an Integrated Development Environment, and a Fourth Generation Language, and has unusual challenges regarding source code protection. We note that intentional spreadsheet applications are largely absent from the error literature. We explain why people might prefer a spreadsheet to an application developed by the IT department, and show how some spreadsheet programmers choose to avoid--or do not have--an IT department.  We find that 1) Spreadsheets are widely used for mission-critical functions; 2) Spreadsheets are an effective application development platform; 3) There is diversity of development skill in creators of mission-critical spreadsheets; 4)  Sophisticated programmers sometimes choose spreadsheets over other languages; 5) Spreadsheets are amenable to formal development practices, but such practices seem rare; 6)  Spreadsheets play a central role in the evolution of business processes and work systems; and 7) Spreadsheets are a source of "accidental legacy systems". We provide the Skill-User Programming Paradigm to help interpret and explain our observations. We conclude that spreadsheets are vitally important to business, and merit sustained research to discover techniques to enhance quality, productivity, and maintainability.

The InfoQual framework provides a sound theoretical basis for defining information quality at three levels: syntactic (form), semantic (content), and pragmatic (usage). Objective measures can be defined for the syntactic and semantic levels. In this paper, we focus on the pragmatic level by developing and empirically testing an instrument that aims to measure subjective aspects of information quality based on the perceptions of information consumers. In combination, such a framework and instrument have the potential to aid organizations in identifying problems and planning improvement strategies for information quality

It examines why this dominance has the potential to harm the future prospects of our intellectual endeavors.  In counterpoint, we present the argument that the use of reference disciplines should continue.  Aside from the fact that the belief in the value of reference discipline is continued, there are benefits derived from anchoring research initiatives in reference discipline theories which should be acknowledged. Under certain situations such use should be encouraged and broadened.  Additionally, we will present arguments for viable alternatives to relying on reference disciplines in theory building. The alternatives are aimed at building and expanding indigenous IS theory.

%X Web 2.0, the current Internet evolution, can be described by several key features of an expanded Web that is more interactive; allows easy social interactions through participation and collaboration from a variety of human sectors; responds more immediately to users' queries and needs; is easier to search; and provides a faster, smoother, realistic and engaging user search capability, often with automatic updates to users. The purpose of this study is three-fold. First, the primary goal is to propose a conceptual Web 2.0 framework that provides better understanding of the Web 2.0 concept by classifying current key components in a holistic manner. Second, using several selective key components from the conceptual framework, this study conducts case analyses of Web 2.0 applications to discuss how they have adopted the selective key features (i.e., participation, collaboration, rich user experience, social networking, semantics, and interactivity responsiveness) of the conceptual Web 2.0 framework. Finally, the study provides insightful discussion of some challenges and opportunities provided by Web 2.0 to education, business, and social life.

%X Context-aware mobile applications are systems that can sense clues about the situational environment and enable appropriate mechanisms of interaction between end users and systems, making mobile devices more intelligent, adaptive, and personalized. In order to better understand such systems and the potentials and barriers of their development and practical use, this paper provides a state-of-the-art overview of this emerging field. Unlike previous literature reviews that mainly focus on technological aspects of such systems, we examine this field mainly from application and research methodology perspectives. We will present major types of current context-aware mobile applications, and discuss research methodologies used in existing studies and their limitations, and highlight potential future research.

%X Malicious insiders present a serious threat to information systems due to privilege of access, knowledge of internal computer resources, and potential threats on the part of disgruntled employees or insiders collaborating with external cybercriminals. Researchers have extensively studied insiders’ motivation to attack from the broader perspective of the deterrence theory and have explored the rationale for employees to disregard/overlook security policies from the perspective of neutralization theory. This research takes a step further: we explore the aggravating variables of insider threat using a multiple case study approach. Empirical research using black hat analysis of three case studies of insider threats suggests that, while neutralization plays an important role in insider attacks, it takes a cumulative set of aggravating factors to trigger an actual data breach. By identifying and aggregating the variables, this study presents a predictive model that can guide IS managers to proactively mitigate insider threats. Given the economic and legal ramifications of insider threats, this research has implications relevant both for both academics and security practitioners.

%X The use of Learning Management System (LMS) in academic institutions is becoming an imperative for many institutions. The success of LMS in academic institutions may be initiated by instructors’ adoption; however, LMS survives in the long run by learners’ continuous adoption and use. Consequently, the objective of this article is to examine the critical factors that influence the success of LMS in blended learning in terms of actual usage, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user satisfaction from the learners’ perspective. The study also examines how these success measures impact learners’ continuous intention to use LMS in blended learning. These critical factors are related to the major entities of LMS adoption: learner characteristics (computer anxiety, technology experience, self-efficacy, and personal innovativeness), instructor characteristics (attitude, teaching style, control, and responsiveness), LMS characteristics (system quality, information quality, and service quality), classmates characteristics (attitude and interaction), course characteristics (quality and flexibility), and organization characteristics (management support and training). Based on 512 learners, the results showed that all of these factors are critical to one or several success measures, except for learner self-efficacy, instructor online responsiveness, and management support. The results also showed that all success measures are critical to learners’ continuous intention to use LMS in blended learning.

%X On August 29th, 2005, Hurricane Katrina slammed into the Gulf Coast causing massive damage throughout Louisiana and Mississippi. Northrop Grumman's Ship Systems sector's facilities in New Orleans, Louisiana and Pascagoula, and Gulfport, Mississippi as well as most of the firms 20,000 employees located in the Gulf were directly impacted by the storm. One data center was destroyed and a second put out of commission for several days. Employees' homes were destroyed and those surviving the storm and their families scattered to safe harbors in neighboring states. Some would never return. Communication to and within the impacted areas was severely disrupted, and the near complete failure of other elements of public infrastructure further delayed the recovery and increased the chaos and suffering. This case looks at Katrina as a very real example of a business continuity disruption that far exceeded the assumptions built into the business continuity plan. It illustrates the essential role that public communication infrastructure plays in disasters such as these, and the risks associated with assuming that communication systems and other public infrastructure will be available in times of cataclysmic failure. The case also demonstrates the unique nature of leadership in a crisis, the problems of pulling together and providing resources to a work force necessary to respond to a crisis, and the unique problems of reassembling, almost from scratch, the necessary information technology infrastructure.

It uses a systems thinking approach to do so, and argues that the discipline may be caught in a vicious cycle of unintended consequences (side effects) that has arisen because of our focus on achieving quality. The paper provides examples of the side effects and posits that we must address these in the short run to increase the quality of both inputs (research conducted and submitted to journals) and outputs (the journals themselves).

%X The newest hot topic in IT is Master Data Management (MDM). MDM is either “the most overused IT buzzword,” the exact meaning of which vendors have yet to agree on,  OR it describes a discipline and technologies for developing a consistent set of identifiers and attributes that describe the core data entities of an organization (e.g., customer, product) OR possibly, something in between. While the definition of MDM is vague, the problem it purports to solve certainly is not. Here, there is general agreement that the data in most organizations is a mess, resulting from years of developing in silos. Most organizations therefore face a multitude of inconsistencies in data definitions, data formats and data values which make it next to impossible for an organization to understand and use its key data.
%X This paper first outlines the business needs which MDM purports to address and defines what MDM is and is not. Next it looks at the “data ecosystem” and where MDM fits within it. Then, it outlines the value proposition for MDM and some of the challenges organizations face in making a business case for it. The last two sections look at some of the pre-requisites which must be put in place before embarking on an MDM program and describe “the data journey” of which MDM is only a part.

%X An assessment of student achievement according to gender in core units of study of a Faculty of Information and Communication Technology program tested four hypotheses. The first of these related to the role-model effect of female academics; the second related to the advantages of formal education qualifications of academics; the third to the application of contextualized curricula, and the fourth to the use of a variety of assessment modes.  Correlation and regression analysis on the data set indicated that the presence of two of these factors can significantly improve the pass rate of female students while having a benign effect on the pass rate of male students. It is suggested that information systems faculties pay close attention to  gender diversity of their teaching faculty, particularly if their female student cohort is less than one in five in a unit of study. It also gives substance to the need or preference for university lecturers having education qualifications. This study needs to be replicated in other information systems faculties and schools to verify this finding.

%X There has been widespread investment in business intelligence/business analytics within industry because of the potential for improved managerial decision-making through mining the vast quantities of data collected by modern corporations;  however, despite major recent curriculum changes in business schools, there has been very little attention given to this field.  This has been true of both research and teaching and is compounded by inadequate quantitative literacy possessed by U.S. students and antipathy towards quantitative literacy among faculty.  This paper documents the importance of business intelligence within business and the programs offered by the 50 leading business schools.  A pioneering minor in the field offered by one school is described.

%X A panel on workforce trends in the information technology industry was held at the AMCIS meeting in Toronto, Canada, in August 2008. Panelists discussed a continuing research project about the current state of the IT workforce and future trends, sponsored by the Society for Information Management (SIM). The initial phase was a study of workforce trends in IT client companies, completed in 2006. Results from phase one revealed a shift in the mission of the information system function from delivering technology-based solutions to managing the process of delivering solutions. Client-facing capabilities were found to be critical to this mission as well as business and project-management capabilities. Phase two examined workforce trends in IT provider companies. Results indicate that provider firms are also seeking client-facing capabilities, project management and business domain knowledge over technical capabilities. Panelists compared the results of the two phases and the implications for curriculum design, hiring, and training practices. The results of this research underline a looming crisis in several areas: 1) graduates who are not trained in areas that the marketplace is seeking; 2) thin pipeline for specific technical skills; 3) increasing pressure to source IT capability; and 4) lag in university responsiveness to the needs of the marketplace.

%X In this study we investigate the effects of user skill and task challenge on online shoppers’ experiences.  We use a model suggested by flow theory in which shoppers are grouped into four categories (flow, anxiety, boredom, and apathy) based on their perceptions of task challenge and their skill in performing an online shopping task.  Results show that anxious shoppers have lower perceptions of the dimensions of flow, believe online shopping Web sites are less useful, and believe they are less likely to use the system in the future compared to the other three groups of online shoppers. In addition to challenge and skill, having a clear goal and fast feedback also contribute to the flow experience.

%X AOL's recent public release of user search information resulted in a heated privacy debate. This case study is a detailed account of this incident. The case is designed as an in-class teaching aid covering managerial, legal, and ethical issues related to privacy. It consists of four sections (A, B, C, and D). Each section is fairly short and is designed to be read in class, separated by discussion of the previous section. Alternatively, the first section might be distributed in advance; though this runs the risk of students identifying the case and jumping ahead in the discussion (AOL's identity is concealed from students until the end of section B). A set of potential discussion questions for each section appears in the appendix. While there are too many questions to be covered in a single class, instructors can choose questions based on their particular teaching objective. A teaching note is also available from the authors.

%X A strong business-IT relationship is critical for an organization’s effective use of IT. This relationship is affected by many factors, such as the sub-function of IT involved, the business unit involved, the management levels involved, changing expectations, and general perceptions of IT. Research suggests that little is known about what contributes to a strong relationship between IT and business, nor even about how to characterize a relationship of this complexity. To explore business-IT relations and better understand how to assess their quality, what might be done to improve them, and the factors that are critical to a successful relationship, the authors convened a focus group of senior IT managers from a variety of industries. In preparation for this day-long session, we asked all participants to prepare a presentation addressing a number of questions about the business-IT relationship in their organizations. This paper presents the results of this discussion, combining our findings with those of other researchers. It first looks at the nature of the business-IT relationship and how an effective relationship could be characterized. Then, it examines each of the four foundational elements of a strong, positive relationship in turn, making suggestions for how IT managers could strengthen them.

The leaders shared their views on the current status of the IS field in terms of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats facing the discipline.  The insights of the leaders are organized into 10 categories, including the core identity of IS, the legitimacy of the IS field, competitors to what we teach and research, research rigor versus relevance, the pervasiveness of information technology, the impacts of changing technology, the quantity and quality of journals, the demand for IS services, and ICIS and AIS.  In many areas the leaders agree on the issues.  Most of the differences of opinion are research related, such as the core identity of the field for research purposes, how to best achieve relevance in our research, and the number of journals in our field.

We introduced new areas of exploration and disseminated new points of view on the potentially negative impacts of IT use. We drew upon our collective research and practice-related insights in five areas that characterize the dark side of IT use, namely―IT-usage-related stress, work overload, interruptions, addiction, and misuse. These are clearly important areas to examine, given that the ubiquitous and functionally pervasive nature of IT use in organizations is expected to expose users to ever greater levels of conditions that are potent for experiencing this dark side. We discussed the relevance and implications of the topic to the IS research and practice communities.

This new digital reality and the unprecedented capabilities it embodies in terms of searchability, aggregatability, temporal persistence, and so on, give rise to great challenges in the areas of Digital Identity Management, Social Impacts, Currency and Accuracy of Digital Data, Distorting Factors, Legal Issues and Implications, among others, that are only just becoming recognized and articulated. This paper reports on a panel exploring these issues and speculating creatively on how they might be addressed in IS academic research by adopting a fundamental information processing approach to design, incorporating analogs from evolutionary biology, for example.

%X Semi-structured interviews were used to collect data. The participants were 16 faculty members (nine adopters and seven non-adopters) from six colleges at a midwestern state university. Findings from this study show the differences between early adopters and non-adopters (the mainstream) in these aspects: knowledge and skill of technology, teaching practices, teaching philosophy, and technology needs. These different perceptions toward Wi-Fi technology lead to diffusion “gap” between early adopters and the mainstream.
%X This diffusion gap implies that a different support infrastructure is needed for mainstream faculty to integrate technology for teaching and learning.  An institution needs to act as a change agent to promote further technology adoption by the mainstream faculty.

We examine the practical and conceptual challenges faced when helping emotionally stressed DV victims to make crucial life decisions. Our focus is on the information needs involved in the early phase of the decision process, viewed in terms of both the transtheoretical model and empowerment theory. We review DV victim-support sites in Australia, the U.S., and the UK to highlight their best-practice design elements. We further illustrate these elements with a paper-based prototype of a DV victim Online Advisory System (OAS) that uses personalisation techniques to provide a sense of empowerment for the DV victim. Empowerment increases the DV victim’s level of self-esteem, reduces their tendency towards self-blame, and reduces their level of anxiety.

%X The entire telecommunications industry is going through very difficult times. Rapidly changing technology, lack of good business models, and lack of visibility in the near-term for renewed growth all create an uncertain environment. Yet, the global Internet is becoming a multi-service network infrastructure that can potentially replace existing disparate voice and data networks. Although it is widely believed in the telecommunications industry that network convergence of voice, data, video, and images is an industry driver, not much attention has yet been paid to a key proposition: what value does network convergence bring to business and residential customers? This paper explains how different industries are converging; the technological, economic and regulatory forces that are at play and how the various customer segments can benefit from network convergence.   While technological advancement is transforming industry and business models rapidly, one question keeps coming back to haunt managers: Where is the business value? We illustrate the value proposition of convergence (for various players) by first explaining the paradigm shifts happening across industries and then highlighting the "high velocity spiral" of knowledge dissemination theory that is fueled by convergence.

%X For the past two decades, researchers have sought to understand how IT investment leads to organizational success. However, this has proven to be an elusive goal. We posit that a new perspective is needed to better understand IT investment.  We must examine how the investment is enacted and reflected within the firm. We will argue that investment is enacted within the technology resources and corresponding business processes and reflected in the IT-business alignment. Based on the literature within Dynamics Capabilities Theory and IT-Business Alignment, we will propose a theoretical model that seeks to understand the impact of IT-enabled business processes and IT-business alignment on the strategic and operational success of a firm and whether the impacts experience a lag effect. Using data from fifty-eight European firms over a two-year period, we will build a structural equation model to test our theoretical model. The results indicate that alignment is important for strategic and operational success in year 1 but not in year 2. Furthermore, of the two, alignment has a stronger impact on strategic than operational success. In contrast, business process performance has an impact on organizational performance in year 1 and year 2. For both years, the impact on operational success is stronger than the strategic one. We also notice that the impact of business process performance on operational success decreases between year 1 and year 2, whereas the impact on strategic success is stronger in year 2 than in year 1.

%X This study investigates the information sources of general computer self-efficacy suggested by its origin in Social Cognitive Theory. These antecedents are rarely explored in the literature, and much of the focus has been on personal experiences or environmental factors. A re-examination of the theoretical foundation of self-efficacy suggests a broader set of antecedents. Selecting business students as the research subject, we propose and test a comprehensive nomological network of computer self-efficacy with seven antecedents and two consequences—computer attitudes and MIS intention (defined as one’s intention to select MIS for his/her future study and career). The results support that computer knowledge, current computing experiences, computer anxiety, and age affected the formation and development of computer self-efficacy among the sampled students; computer self-efficacy and social norms had strong effects on computer attitudes and MIS intention. Implications for both research and MIS education are discussed.

%X Theory development and theory testing are two primary processes in social science research. Statistical methods and tools are used in various stages of these processes. Information systems researchers have employed many statistical methods and tools for theory testing. However, very few statistical approaches are known to help researchers with theory development. In this paper, we introduce TETRAD as a powerful approach to aid researchers in developing and discovering new theoretical relationships. We illustrate the TETRAD approach by re-analyzing data from two articles published in premier information systems journals. The results from the previous examples demonstrate that TETRAD is a useful tool for uncovering potential theoretical relationships, especially when prior knowledge of underlying theory bases is lacking. We demonstrate that TETRAD is an effective and powerful statistical tool that can assist researchers in the iterative process of theory development.

Organizations have to continuously manage their investment in information security technologies in an attempt to minimize the damage caused by information resource breaches. This article proposes an economic model in an attempt to evaluate the trade-offs between security and disaster-recovery technologies. The article intends to provide a directional strategy for managers in terms of increasing budgetary allocations for each of these technologies. The proposed model presents insights for managers.

%X Diverse aspects of our everyday lives increasingly feature sensor-based technologies. Despite the importance of understanding how business and consumers exploit and adopt these technologies, the information systems (IS) community has thus far devoted relatively little attention to the topic. Accordingly, in this paper, we foster an exploration of the issue among IS scholars by focusing on the emergent use of sensor-based technologies in the automotive insurance industry. Insurance providers have increasingly begun to turn to such technologies to gain competitive advantage around risk assessment and behavior-based pricing. To investigate this phenomenon, we consider the experiences of two organizations operating distinct national contexts: Progressive Insurance (US) and Generali (Italy). These two insurance providers have been first movers in adopting sensor-based technologies for risk assessment and policy pricing. First, we highlight the key similarities and differences between the cases with regard to the technologies adopted, business models pursued, and anticipated benefits and pitfalls for the companies and their consumers. Second, in a more holistic way, we discuss the implications and unintended consequences of sensor-based technologies in the automotive insurance industry. We formulate several research questions that provide opportunities and encourage more research in this emerging area of study.

%X Neil McBride (2018) asks if information systems (IS) is a science. He perceives several problems with current research practice and attitudes in information systems and proposes that we should treat it as a discipline in the humanities akin to dance studies. However, his proposal does not recognize that IS deals with both technology and humans. Further, he does not consider the different views of science and that one can view information systems as a science of the artificial in which one develops actionable knowledge in accordance with available evidence and uses scientific techniques in part. Failure to apply well-founded knowledge in building and applying technology can have significant adverse societal consequences, and professionals would see it as unethical. Since these considerations scarcely apply to dance studies, it appears a poor model for information systems.

%X The validation of information systems research instruments has not received the attention that it deserves. Based on data obtained from 174 Australian CIOs, we use component-based structural equation modelling (PLS/SEM) to investigate the psychometric properties and possible modeling of the highly regarded CIO role expectations instrument that Smaltz, Sambamurthy, and Agarwal (2006) have developed. Results show that the CIO role expectations instrument exhibits solid validity and reliability indices despite some minor weaknesses. The results also demonstrate the possibility to model the constructs of this instrument in different null and hierarchical models, and they provide further empirical support for the validity of this instrument to measure the CIO role in different countries and different types of industries beyond the U.S. healthcare sector in which Smaltz et al. developed it. The results provide support for CIO role theory on two central issues: CIOs are fulfilling a configuration of roles not just one specific role, and the CIO roles can be grouped into two major categories: supply (operational) side roles and demand (business) side roles.

%X Researchers in many fields have adopted simulation to understand a system’s behavior by imitating it through an artificial object that exhibits nearly identical behavior. Although simulation approaches have been widely adopted for theory building in fields such as engineering, computer science, management, and social sciences, researchers in the IS field often overlook their potential. In this paper, we examine how IS research uses different simulation approaches and, thereby, provide insights and methodological recommendations for future studies. From reviewing the literature on simulation studies published in top-tier IS journals, we define three classes of simulations: the self-organizing, the elementary, and the situated. We identify a set of stylized facts for characterizing the ways in which IS simulation studies present the premise, the inference, and the contribution. As a result, we provide guidance to future simulation researchers in designing and presenting their findings.

%X For the first time since the 2008 financial crisis, Lenovo, the world’s largest PC maker, had not only failed to increase its revenues and profits but also a net loss. Lenovo’s market share was still growing, but the PC market itself was shrinking by about five percent annually. Lenovo hoped to broaden its leadership toward smaller computing devices, a market that had seen more growth. It purchased Motorola Mobility in 2014 and continued to invest in its smartphone business through branding and innovation. Yet, in 2016, this business did not make a profit and only grew in some geographical markets. Lenovo faced fierce competition from giants such as Apple and Samsung and from Chinese manufacturers that had quickly grown in market share. How could Lenovo reignite growth and sustain its position as a global industry leader?

%X In this design science research paper, we report on our constructing and evaluating an attention-guidance system that we integrated into a computer-supported collaborative learning system. Drawing on social constructivist literature, our proposed design focuses on attracting, retaining, and, if necessary, reacquiring users’ attention on task-relevant information in online collaborative literature processing. The investigation involved an experiment across two sections of students in a human-computer interaction course. Results show that the new design allowed users to consistently reflect and evaluate the content of a text as they capitalized on one another’s reasoning to resolve misconceptions. Moreover, we found that the new system increased users’ perceptions of learning. However, the difference in knowledge gain scores was marginally significant and represented a medium effect size. Interestingly, we found that the attention-guidance system supported more efficient learning. Finally, we discovered that task-oriented reading of text, revisions of incomplete or incorrect ideas, and perceptions of learning mediated the relationship between software system and learning efficiency. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications.

%X Information systems (IS) enrollment has been declining in recent years. In an attempt to introduce key IS concepts to freshmen business students in a more engaging way, we introduced a semester-long mobile application-design project and a separate tutorial assignment involving real smartphones. Through this process, students learned basic tenets of IS while simultaneously recognizing the relevance and applicability of the field to their future lives as 21st century business professionals. In this paper, we outline the core course progression for a typical IS department, detail the process through which we engaged the students, and confirm our assertions through textual analysis of self-reported comments about their experience with this mobile application project.

Citation counts can be generated from a number of data collections, including Thomson’s ISI database and Google Scholar.  This paper reports on an exploratory study of the apparent impact of IS researchers, as disclosed by citation counts of their works in those two collections. Citation analysis using currently available databases is found to be fraught with many serious problems, particularly if the ISI collection is used.  Unless these problems are appreciated and addressed, IS researchers will be under-valued by those with authority over research funding and employment, to the serious detriment of the IS discipline.

This paper investigates the impact of service-centric computing on business and education. We first examine the transformative impacts of service-centric computing on business and education in the foreseeable future. Then, we discuss opportunities and challenges in new research directions and instructional innovations with respect to service-centric computing. We believe that this article will serve as a good starting point for our IS colleagues to explore this exciting and emerging area of research and teaching.

%X Using secondary data from 113 countries and the literature on Resource Based View [RBV] and Information Technology [IT] impact as the guiding theoretical lenses, we examine the relationships of e-government development and e-participation with national business competitiveness. E-government development represents the level of functional sophistication of e-government Web sites in a nation whereas e-participation is the level of country’s willingness to engage citizens in e-government processes. In addition, we analyze the moderating role of country environment on the relationships between e-government development and business competitiveness and also between e-participation and business competitiveness.
%X Our results highlight strong association of e-government development as well as e-participation with national business competitiveness. Further, our results also show the moderating role of human capital, public institutions and macro-economic conditions on the relationship between e-government development and business competitiveness of a nation. Human capital and public institutions positively moderate this relationship whereas macro-economic environment marginally moderates the relationship in the negative direction. In contrast to this, the relationship between e-participation and business competitiveness is positively moderated only by national human capital. Further, we also analyze the combined relationship of e-government development and e-participation (e-government maturity) with national business competitiveness and observe that e-government maturity is also significantly related to national business competitiveness. Through this research, we make some important contributions that have implications for research and practice.

%X In this paper we examine the ways in which implementing new information and communication technologies (ICTs) to automate public sector processes affects accountability. New technologies alter conventional modes of behavior in the public sector, shedding light on certain areas of bureaucratic practice and obscuring others, and in doing so they enhance accountability and exacerbate dysfunctions. To investigate how ICTs influence the accountability equation, we explore a range of empirically documented e-government implementations, from simple transactions involving low-levels of automation to highly automated systems such as fingerprint analysis technologies. Drawing on these empirical examples, we develop a tentative framework of ICT-exacerbated accountability dysfunctions. Following this, we then discuss potential accountability arrangements for different types of e-government processes, in hope of realizing the benefits of new technologies while minimizing the potential for unaccountability and dysfunction that could arise from their application. Throughout, we stress the necessity of striking a balance between the potential benefits of ICTs to the bureaucratic process and systems that may reduce efficiency but uphold accountability.

%X Among the many characteristics that impact the use of e-commerce, one that has received relatively little attention is gender. Extant evidence suggests that men and women differ in their beliefs regarding the use of information technology-related innovations, including e-commerce. However, less is known about how gender moderates the impact of various beliefs on behavioral intentions. In this study, we use a model derived from diffusion of innovations theory to examine gender differences in the degree to which various beliefs regarding e-commerce impact intentions to make purchases online. Results indicate that gender does moderate the influence of beliefs on use intentions in the context of consumer e-commerce. Specifically, our study finds that relative advantage is relatively more important for men and that compatibility is relatively more important for women. We explain why this may be true, discuss the implications of these findings and suggest several areas for future research.

%X The use of pilot studies to evaluate the economic justification of technology projects is common in practice. The pilot studies play even greater role in the projects affecting customer interactions with the product/service offerings since perception and/or reaction of customers is captured and analyzed through such studies. Yet, many times the methodology used in these studies lacks rigor and comprehensiveness, and there are scopes for further improvement. The current literature provides limited information on how the pilot studies should be used to decide whether to go ahead with a proposed technology project or not. In this paper we present guidelines for effectively using pilot studies in making such decisions. With the help of a real-life pilot study on deployment of RFID technology in parking operations at a university, we discuss how the proposed guidelines may be implemented to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the proposed project. In recent times RFID technology is getting increasing attention and many organizations are in the process of deploying this technology. The paper offers a timely and cost-effective evaluation study of a particular application of RFID technology. We found that users’ benefits and costs played a crucial role in determining whether the proposed project should go forward or not. Also, we found that intangible benefits and costs to be important. These findings along with our discussions on the general methodology will provide practical guidelines for evaluating viability of technology projects using pilot studies.

%X Mega-programmes are prevalent across the world in areas of national importance, such as health, education, and security. In the United Kingdom, the National Programme for IT (NPfIT), coordinated by the agency ‘Connecting for Health’ (CfH), is one such example. This programme aims to transform the provision of healthcare through the creation of a new IT infrastructure connecting doctors, nurses and health care professionals across England. This network will support a range of online applications, for maintaining patient records, booking appointments, prescribing medication and transferring digital images. The vision of a fully information-driven National Health Service is attractive on many grounds, yet no nation has found it easy to realize. In this paper, we present four perspectives on the implementation issues surrounding the UK Programme, which address a cross-section of the expectations and anxieties of those involved, and the multiple outcomes achieved. We examine the tensions and opportunities in what is taking place, and draw out policy implications from our work.

%X This paper assesses Internet diffusion and its determinants in Kenya using the Global Diffusion of the Internet (GDI) framework. Kenya was selected due to its strategic importance for the economic progress of the great lakes region of Africa. An understanding of Internet diffusion in Kenya provides preliminary insight into how the process might unfold in Eastern Africa.
%X The analysis shows that in 2008, less than 10 percent of the population accessed the Internet, with a majority of users clustered around two major urban centers. There is an indication that across the sectors of education, commerce, health, and public service, the Internet is being embraced, with potential for further diffusion. The underlying national Internet connectivity infrastructure is well established, but skewed in favor of urban centers that have high levels of electricity penetration. Vibrant competition exists between Internet service providers despite a persistent monopoly in national fixed line telecommunications provision. A few sophisticated applications of the Internet were found in several sectors.
%X A snap shot of the state of Internet diffusion in Kenya reflects, on average, good performance on the various dimensions of the GDI framework. However, this overall picture masks the reality that the majority of the population, mostly in rural areas, lack access to basic amenities such as electricity, and hence infrastructure to support the Internet. The trajectory along which the Internet is diffusing has therefore led to the exclusion of this majority. The critical role that governments in developing countries play needs to be brought to the fore in order to ensure that the Internet diffusion trajectory is not left entirely to the commercial sector. The government’s ability to marshal resources, execute telecommunications regulation, as well as enable change remains pivotal to ensuring inclusive Internet diffusion.

%X The way in which information technology (IT) impacts firm productivity is an enduring question in organizational research and practice.  Rather than adopting the common explanation that IT spending improves organizational performance, we hypothesize that IT spending determines the amount of IT assets, such as IT hardware, IT personnel, IT systems, and IT outsourcing, that can be acquired.  These IT assets, in turn, affect productivity.  The context of our study is the healthcare industry.  Because of the unique set of managerial values, incentives, and constraints in this industry, we also hypothesize that IT personnel play a key role in determining hospital productivity.  Analysis of panel data on acute-care centers provides support for our hypotheses.  This paper contributes to literature by (1) refining earlier research that explains that IT spending improves organizational productivity; (2) examining the interrelationships between various types of IT assets; and (3) providing initial indications that outsourcing of the IT function may not have the beneficial effects in healthcare that it does in other industries.

%X The boundaries and contours of design sciences continue to undergo definition and refinement. In many ways, the sciences of design defy disciplinary characterization. They demand multiple epistemologies, theoretical orientations (e.g. construction, analysis or intervention) and value considerations. As our understanding of this emerging field of study grows, we become aware that the sciences of design require a systemic perspective that spans disciplinary boundaries. The Doctoral Consortium at the Design Science Research Conference in Information Sciences and Technology (DESRIST) was an important milepost in their evolution. It provided a forum where students and leading researchers in the design sciences challenged one another to tackle topics and concerns that are similar across different disciplines. This paper reports on the consortium outcomes and insights from mentors who took part in it. We develop a set of observations to guide the evolution of the sciences of design. It is our intent that the observations will be beneficial, not only for IS researchers,  but also for colleagues in allied disciplines who are already contributing to shaping the sciences of design.

%X When challenged to justify the value of information systems (IS) research, decision support systems (DSS) is usually cited as one the most compelling examples of where IS research made the transition successfully from theoretical academic journals into the "real-world". In light of this assessment, it is somewhat surprising that offerings of DSS courses waned over the years. This paper identifies several possible reasons for the decline in DSS course offerings and suggests innovative approaches using spreadsheets for breathing new-life into this cornerstone of the IS field.

%X Web surveys potentially cost less to administer and are more convenient for participants than either telephone or paper-based surveys, but concern remains about the representativeness of the respondents to the population. This research investigates the effectiveness of using Web-based survey methods by comparing response rates and demographic characteristics of the telephone-based and web-based survey respondents. The paper first reviews survey research methodologies, including recent trends in web-based surveys that take advantage of the power of modern computing and telecommunications technology. The issue of respondent characteristics in web-based surveys is then explored by comparing respondent demographics of an ongoing telephone survey to those of a subsequent Web survey of the same population. Exploratory and confirmatory statistical analyses are used to triangulate the findings and test the hypotheses. The data suggests that demographics of the respondents of the two methods are similar across race and age, but differ significantly across income and education levels, implying a converging digital divide.

%X The use of computer-mediated communication technology across different countries and cultures is under-investigated in information systems (IS) research. The measurement equivalence issue in cross-cultural IS studies has also not been addressed adequately. This study applies a rigorous structural equation modeling approach (SEM) to compare differences between two groups of college students in the United States and China, by adapting a research model that explains an individual’s use of Instant Messaging (IM). After achieving measurement equivalence across the two groups using SEM, we found that, in their behavioral intention to use IM, Chinese students paid more attention to the effect of perceived enjoyment, while Americans placed more emphasis on perceived usefulness. We found that relationship commitment was more salient in explaining perceived enjoyment for Chinese than for Americans. We also found that the effects of perceived critical mass on perceived enjoyment and perceived usefulness were stronger for Americans than for Chinese. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that the effect of relationship commitment on perceived usefulness was stronger for Americans than for Chinese. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

%X The model of an anytime-anywhere workforce is changing the landscape of business today. Increasingly employees are being emancipated from their traditional offices by the widespread infiltration of technologies that facilitate this model. The question is, how can we characterize the culture developing in support of these new ways of working and how can they be cultivated? Understanding this “ nomadic culture ” is critical to both researchers and practitioners. Due to the newness of these technologies and the speed of their integration into today’s work practices, prior research lends little direction in understanding this developing culture. This research contributes by proposing and validating a multidimensional model of nomadic culture. The model describes nomadic culture in terms of three levels: underlying assumptions, espoused values, and artifacts. Each level is then described more specifically by eight measurable nomadic culture sub-constructs. Using the Structural Equation Modeling technique, proposed relationships among the sub-constructs are tested along with the effect of organizational support for nomadic behaviors on employee job satisfaction. Significant support for the model was found in data collected from 203 working IT professionals from a wide variety of organizations. Suggestions for future research as well as implications for practice are provided.

%X In many organisations, information technology (IT) has become crucial in the support, sustainability, and growth of the business. This pervasive use of technology has created a critical dependency on IT that calls for a specific focus on IT governance. IT governance consists of the leadership and organisational structures and processes that enable the required alignment between business and IT. This practice-oriented research concentrates on the IT governance practices that organisations can leverage to implement IT governance in reality. Based on literature research, pilot case research and Delphi research, this paper provides insights regarding the effectiveness and ease of implementation of IT governance practices and provides a minimum baseline of practices that organisations at least should have. Via this research, we want to contribute to new theory building and assist practitioners by providing more guidance on how IT governance can be effectively implemented.

%X PART A: Forced by operational inefficiencies in its own business model, CHEP, the market leader in the rental pallet business, became an early adopter of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. Having proven the effectiveness of the technology for internal operations with a pilot test, CHEP now had to find clients who want to adopt the technology-enabled services in order to pay for a large scale roll out. The case traces CHEP’s challenges associated with the development and deployment RFID in its own operation and raises questions of how to proceed with potential IT-enabled change at the enterprise and supply chain level, without spoiling relationships with current clients and maintaining its core business. PART B: In fall 2007, Brian Beattie and Puneet Sawhney looked back at CHEP’s RFID initiative and the progress that has been made since the 2003 decision to further incorporate the technology into its assets. While the original intent of tagging all pallets did not materialize, considerable progress had been made into quantifying the benefits of RFID adoption. Industry-wide developments had changed the scope of the RFID initiative from simply tagging the asset pool to creating value added service for CHEP’s clients. Overall, RFID had yet to revolutionize the supply chain, but the evolution of technology and the innovation of RFID related products and services had aided CHEP in maintaining its market leadership in the pallet business and enabled CHEP to created new lines of business.

%X The bursting of the dot com bubble in March 2000 caused firms to be wary about investment in, and the use of, information technologies. Consequently, demand in technology-related jobs dropped significantly. This drop in demand has had a profound negative impact on the demand for information systems (IS) courses in the tertiary education sector. Some IS departments suffered badly, and some were forced to downsize their faculty through attrition, giving back faculty lines, freezing hiring, or releasing faculty. At the same time, there has been significant and sustained growth in demand for accounting programs. Professional accounting bodies have introduced technologies to accountants and auditors, and technologies have gained its significance in the accounting discipline. With such an observation, this paper explores whether accounting students see IS courses as a complement to their program and the chance to offer IS-related courses to accounting students. We administrated a survey to explore accounting students’ preferences for accounting-related disciplines. We then conducted a number of focus groups to gain an understanding of their expectations and interest in technology-related courses. We found that although accounting students preferred finance courses to IS courses, they were interested in IS and considered IS to be useful to their long-term career. We then proposed several IS courses customized for accounting students. This will open up more teaching opportunities for IS academics, and strengthens the IS programs by providing stability in an otherwise unstable environment. After the rationale for a list of proposed IS-related courses for accounting students, we discussed some issues that IS academics should pay attention to before launching these courses.

%X Government agencies need to transform the way in which they are organized in order to be able to provide better services to their constituents and adapt to changes in legislation. Whereas much e-government research has a technology focus, our goal is to investigate whether business architectures can help governments to recreate agencies to make them robust in dealing with political preferences, and further, whether their adoption can guide the realization of IT-oriented enterprise architectures. In this article the concept of business architecture and its implications are analyzed by investigating the case study of the Dutch Immigration and Naturalization Services. The case demonstrates the mediating role business architectures can play between policy and strategy on the one hand, and enterprise IT architecture on the other. Business architectures help: (1) to define business domains and the events connecting them, and (2) to use principles to integrate the domains and ensure synergies. Business domains can be designed and operated independently, which enable higher levels of adaptability. Our case analyses show that the pluriformity of the political visions, public values, and actors involved and the division of responsibilities complicate the creation of a business architecture.

%X Management scholars have articulated the importance of occupational cultures in understanding employee behaviors in organizations. In keeping with this theme, Information Systems (IS) scholars have begun examining the occupational culture of IS personnel. It is generally argued that culture is important because cultural differences lead to conflicts and thus to dysfunctional interactions. A comparison of the occupational cultures of two groups can help identify potential conflicts that could ensue when the members from the two groups interact. In the current study, we interviewed IS personnel and management personnel to identify their respective cultural beliefs along group and grid dimensions proposed in Trice’s theoretical framework for characterizing occupational cultures. Based on these interviews, we have analyzed the belief systems of the two groups and highlighted the potential for conflict.

%X Researchers and practitioners have consistently reported poor requirements elicitation (RE) as one of the major reasons for information system (IS) project failures. In the last two decades, RE research and practice have focused predominantly on developing tools and techniques for business analysts (BAs) to use and improve RE; however, they have paid little attention to the importance of the competency of the BAs involved in RE. We investigate the relationship between the BAs’ competency and RE through an exploratory study. We applied a thematic network analysis approach, along with a four-stage qualitative data-analysis process, to discover four business view and six system view themes and their relationships to BAs’ competency. Our results indicate that senior, intermediate, and junior BAs performed similarly in selecting stakeholders’ viewpoints and collecting requirements from them; however, senior BAs focused more on high-level requirements than the low-level technical requirements of the system. The results suggest that BAs’ competency play a significant role in RE and that organizations that clearly define BAs’ competency can help them to identify the right BA for the right job.

%X Social media and the interactive Web have enabled human traffickers to lure victims and then sell them faster and in greater safety than ever before. However, these same tools have also enabled investigators in their search for victims and criminals. We used system development action research methodology to create and apply a prototype designed to identify victims of human sex trafficking by analyzing online ads. The prototype used a knowledge management approach of generating actionable intelligence by applying a set of strong filters based on an ontology to identify potential victims. We used the prototype to analyze a data set generated from online ads. We used the results of this process to generate a revised prototype that included the use of machine learning and text mining enhancements. We used the revised prototype to identify potential victims in a second data set. The results of applying the prototypes suggest a viable approach to identifying victims of human sex trafficking in online ads.

%X In recent years, efforts to assess faculty research productivity have focused more on the measurable quantification of academic outcomes. For benchmarking academic performance, researchers have developed different ranking and rating lists that define so-called high-quality research. While many scholars in IS consider lists such as the Senior Scholar’s basket (SSB) to provide good guidance, others who belong to less-mainstream groups in the IS discipline could perceive these lists as constraining. Thus, we analyzed the perceived impact of the SSB on information systems (IS) academics working in design science research (DSR) and, in particular, how it has affected their research behavior. We found the DSR community felt a strong normative influence from the SSB. We conducted a content analysis of the SSB and found evidence that some of its journals have come to accept DSR more. We note the emergence of papers in the SSB that outline the role of theory in DSR and describe DSR methodologies, which indicates that the DSR community has rallied to describe what to expect from a DSR manuscript to the broader IS community and to guide the DSR community on how to organize papers for publication in the SSB.

It has since evolved into a mini-track, a research cluster, and, finally, a full research track that encompasses research knowledge, innovation, and entrepreneurial systems. In this paper, we acquaint knowledge system researchers with a research community that has leveraged HICSS to develop a rich history of high-quality scholastic inquiry in the knowledge system, knowledge management, innovation systems, entrepreneurial systems, organizational memory, and organizational learning research areas.

This novel approach to teaching complex concepts and skills to business students has been received with enthusiasm, and it provides a unique and memorable experience for students to draw on as they encounter situations in which they will apply design thinking in the future. Additionally, student-produced games and student reflections on the workshops provide initial evidence of the value of teaching design thinking through this type of experiential method. In this article we review key design thinking concepts, report on our continuing efforts to incorporate these principles into video game design workshops in the MBA curriculum, and conclude with reflections on improvements for future iterations in hopes that these lesson plans will be shared and will add value to other institutions teaching design thinking. Workshop lesson plans and student projects can be found online at http://www.kolobkreations.com/GDWweb/GDWHome.html.

We argue that heterogeneities in e-auction markets exist and understanding them can benefit market participants. A spider program was developed to collect live auction data of commodity transactions from e-auction markets in three different countries: Australia, the United  Kingdom, and the United States. Our results confirm heterogeneities across these markets. We also found that each e-auction market has a different set of success factors. The article concludes with recommendations to participating members of auctions.

%X The scientific enterprise relies on a peer-review process to maintain the quality of academic discourse and to ensure researchers develop a valid and consistent cumulative body of knowledge. In recent years, it appears that the review capacity in the IS field has decreased, which indicates that the community’s hunger for publication accompanies only a modest appetite for providing the necessary support to sustain the consequent increase in peer-review load. The advent of blockchain technologies and the proliferation of cryptocurrencies presents an opportunity to develop a token-based peer-review payment system that can clear the congested review pipelines while also controlling for quality and spreading the equity that peer review generates in a fair fashion through market-regulation mechanisms. Despite the digital transformation of the publishing industry, little has been done thus far to address the chronic inefficiency of the review process. The typical review cycles, which are measured in years, suggest that something needs to change. Developing a token-based peer-review payment system may be an opportunity not only to address the apparent challenge in the peer-review process but also to assert our proclaimed role as stewards of the digital revolution.

By doing so, we answer Palvia, Daneshvar Kakhki, Ghoshal, Uppala, and Wang’s (2015) call to provide continuous updates to the research trends in IS  due to the discipline’s dynamism. Second, building on Sidorov, Evangelopoulos, Valacich, and Ramakrishnan (2008) we examine temporal trends in prominent research streams over the last 17 years. We show that, as IS research evolves over time, certain themes appear to endure the test of time, while others peak and trough. More importantly, our analysis identifies new emergent themes that have begun to gain prominence in IS research community. Further, we break down our findings by journal and show the type of content that they may desire most. Our findings also allow the IS research community to discern the specific contributions and roles of our premier journals in the evolution of research themes over time.

%X Building highly available information technology (IT) infrastructures has become critical to many corporations’ survival. However, the disaster recovery (DR) industry lacks a common enterprise framework to capitalize on the value that DR provides corporations due in part to inadequate conceptual frameworks for DR that can facilitate the alignment of corporate efforts toward corporate resiliency. To address this problem, we propose a new conceptualization for the DR of enterprise architecture. This conceptual framework comprises DR layers that describe the nature of DR and its related components from a functional and technical point of view. We discuss the benefits of these DR layers to DR teams and compare our approach to traditional thinking. Further, we present a case study, its findings, and their implications for DR. As a result, we demonstrate how our layered framework of enterprise architecture provides a unified understanding of the DR practice, which one can then use to support decision making and corporate alignment of the DR practice and its associated technology.

%X Younger scholars often receive advice to submit work to conferences for feedback and polishing in anticipation that they will later submit it to a journal for publication. But is this a normal practice? What do the IS scholars really think or do about the linkage between conferences and journals? What are IS journals’ policies and their editors-in-chiefs’ views on that linkage? This paper explores aspects of the relationship between conference presentation and journal publication, which include motivations for participating in conferences, potential for subsequent publication, preferred journal targets, and progress of paper development following conference presentation. We obtained data that form the basis for our findings and recommendations from two main sources: 1) a panel study with two sequential surveys of IS scholars who presented papers at three consecutive International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS) meetings (in St. Louis 2010, Shanghai 2011, and Orlando 2012) and 2) an email interview with the editors-in-chief of 21 major IS journals in regard to their respective journals’ policies and their personal views. The paper provides recommendations for various stakeholders including scholars, journal editors, conference organizers, leaders in the field, and anyone outside the IS field who wants to understand its norms and culture.

%X We develop a framework for understanding the mechanisms of information privacy assimilation in information technology (IT) organizations. Following neo-institutional theory, we develop a broad conceptual model and further build a detailed theory based on a multi-site, multi-case study of 18 organizations. We treat information privacy as a distinct dimension separate from information security. As in the case of information security, senior management support emerged as a mediator between the external influences of coercive, mimetic, and normative forces and information privacy assimilation. Privacy capability emerged as a distinct construct that had a moderating effect on the influence of coercive and normative forces on privacy assimilation. Similarly, cultural acceptability also moderated the effect of external forces on privacy assimilation. We produce a theoretical model that future research can empirically test. The findings would enable senior managers identify and respond to institutional pressures by focusing on appropriate factors in the organizations.

As ICT further integrates into our daily lives, it creates more opportunities to both help and hinder fundamental social problems throughout the world. In response to these growing and urgent societal needs, the Association for Information Systems approved the Bright ICT Initiative to extend IS research beyond a focus on business to take on the broader challenges of an ICT-enabled bright society. We conducted a Delphi study to provide guidance on where bright ICT-minded researchers might focus to produce their greatest impact. In this paper, we report on our findings. The Delphi panel comprised 182 globally distributed IS journal editors who participated in a three-round consensus-building process via the Internet. Our results provide a framework of eleven research priority areas and specific research topics for those engaged in future-oriented, socially conscious IS research.

%X Partial least squares (PLS) is one of the most popular analytical techniques employed in the information systems field. In recent years, researchers have begun to revisit commonly used rules-of-thumb about the minimum sample sizes required to obtain reliable estimates for the parameters of interest in structural research models. Of particular importance in this regard is the a priori assessment of statistical power, which provides valuable information to be used in the design and planning of research studies. Though the importance of conducting such analyses has been recognized for quite some time, a review of the empirical research employing PLS indicates that they are not regularly conducted or reported. One likely reason is the lack of software support for these analyses in popular PLS packages. In this tutorial, we address this issue by providing, in tutorial form, the steps and code necessary to easily conduct such analyses. We also provide guidance on the reporting results.

%X Our understanding of factors influencing the effectiveness of software-development processes has evolved in recent times. However, few research studies have furthered our understanding of the cognitive factors underlying software development activities and their impact on performance and affective outcomes. To some extent, this may be attributed to the paucity of measurement approaches available for cognitive factors. In this study, we fill this gap by developing a measurement approach to capture and evaluate the quality of mental models. We investigate the efficacy of mental models in software development using the said approach. We assessed mental model quality by statistically comparing a software developer’s mental model with a referent model derived from multiple experts. Results of a controlled laboratory experiment suggest that a software developer’s mental model quality is a determinant of software quality. Further, we found this effect to be consistent across software development tasks of varying complexities. These results not only shed light on the impact of mental models in software development, but also have significant implications for stimulating future research on cognitive factors influencing software development practices.

%X Educational institutions around the world increasingly view mobile technology as an effective platform for educating a new generation of students. Unfortunately, educational institutions often fail to achieve substantial results with their mobile-learning initiatives. Studies on m-learning have produced several recommendations about how to improve of its success. These recommendations cover a set of factors limited to people, technology, and pedagogy. This qualitative case study adopts a broader socio-technical perspective on m-learning and produces an extended list of critical success factors in m-learning. These factors fall into organization, people, pedagogy, and technology domains. I used the Abilene Christian University as the site for this study. Additional critical success factors I uncovered include executive involvement, resource allocation, technology injection, supporting creation of m-learning content and applications, technological pluralism, championship, infrastructure development, pedagogical freedom, collaboration, continuous learning and improvement, and external recognition.

%X We gathered information about junior faculty research productivity in the information systems (IS) field in North America and in a set of top Asian schools. Our work complements prior studies on IS faculty research productivity in several ways. First, we focused on junior faculty research productivity, which refers to publication records of current tenure-track assistant professors. To provide statistics with a greater coverage of IS researchers, we also collected information about the pre-tenure publication records of associate professors. Second, we covered IS researchers who obtained their doctoral degrees in or after the year 2000 and counted their publications until 2013 to provide the most up-to-date information about junior faculty research productivity. Third, we collected information about IS researchers’ publications in leading IS journals (based on the AIS Senior Scholar basket of journals) and in elite broader business journals (based on the Financial Times list and UT Dallas list). Finally, examining junior faculty research productivity in the IS field in Asian schools and in North America enabled us to provide recommendations for promotion and tenure standards for Asian schools in light of the research productivity and tenure standards in North America.

%X Developing Information Systems (IS) skills for a company’s workforce has always been challenging, but global sourcing growth has caused the determination of needed IS skills to be more complex. The increased use of outsourcing to an IS service provider and from high-wage regions to low-wage regions has affected what IS skills are required globally and how to distribute the workforce to meet these needs. To understand what skills are needed in locations that seek and those that provide outsourcing, we surveyed IS service provider managers in global locations. Results from 126 reporting units provide empirical evidence that provider units in low-wage regions value technical skills more than those in high-wage regions. Despite the emphasis on commodity skills in low-wage areas, high- and low-wage providers value project management skills. Low-wage regions note global and virtual teamwork more than high-wage regions do. The mix of skills and the variation by region have implications for domestic and offshore sourcing. Service providers can vary their staffing models in global regions which has consequences for recruiting, corporate training, and curriculum.

%X The 23rd Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS’17) included nine panels over three days. In this report, we overview each panel and provide the contact information of each panel’s moderator so that readers can reach out to obtain additional information. The panels addressed a range of ongoing and emerging concerns of our discipline: one panel addressed IT security auditing, two addressed pedagogy, three addressed digital infrastructure, and another three addressed academic programs in analytics and information systems. We also discuss logistics of organizing panels, which individuals who organize future panels at AIS-affiliated conferences should find helpful.

%X The information systems (IS) field contains a rich body of knowledge on approaches, methods, and frameworks that supports researchers in conducting design science research (DSR). It also contains some consensus about the key elements of DSR projects—such as problem identification, design, implementation, evaluation, and abstraction of design knowledge. Still, we lack any commonly accepted tools that address the needs of DSR scholars who seek to structure, manage, and present their projects. Indeed, DSR endeavors, which are often complex and multi-faceted in nature and involve various stakeholders (e.g., researchers, developers, practitioners, and others), require the support that such tools provide. Thus, to investigate the tools that DSR scholars actually need to effectively and efficiently perform their work, we conducted an open workshop with DSR scholars at the 2017 DESRIST conference in Karlsruhe, Germany, to debate 1) the general requirement categories of DSR tool support and 2) the more specific requirements. This paper reports on the results from this workshop. Specifically, we identify nine categories of requirements that fall into the three broad phases (pre-design, design, and post design) and that contribute to a software ecosystem for supporting DSR endeavors.

%X With the advances in sensor technology and real-time processing of neurophysiological data, a growing body of academic literature has begun to explore how live biofeedback can be integrated into information systems for everyday use. While researchers have traditionally studied live biofeedback in the clinical domain, the proliferation of affordable mobile sensor technology enables researchers and practitioners to consider live biofeedback as a user interface element in contexts such as decision support, education, and gaming. In order to establish the current state of research on live biofeedback, we conducted a literature review on studies that examine self and foreign live biofeedback based on neurophysiological data for healthy subjects in an information systems context. By integrating a body of highly fragmented work from computer science, engineering and technology, information systems, medical science, and psychology, this paper synthesizes results from existing research, identifies knowledge gaps, and suggests directions for future research. In this vein, this review can serve as a reference guide for researchers and practitioners on how to integrate self and foreign live biofeedback into information systems for everyday use.

%X In this paper, we use graph theory to explore concepts of influence in socialized groups. When analyzing social networks, centrality indicators make it possible to assess the power of an individual. We discuss various centrality indicators and focus on degree and betweenness. After observing a strong correlation between them, we propose defining new assessments based on a decorrelation method that we characterize from different mathematical perspectives (algebraic, probabilistic, and statistical). We apply this theoretical framework to a network of tweets about the Uber versus taxi conflict, which took place in June, 2015, and for which we detected different influential individuals.

%X Whether Information Systems should or should not be part of the core business school curriculum is a recurring discussion in many universities.  In this article, a task force of 40 prominent information systems scholars address the issue.  They conclude that information systems is absolutely an essential body of knowledge for business school students to acquire as well as a key element of the business school's long-run strategic positioning within the university.  Originally prepared in response to draft accreditation guidelines prepared by AACSB International, the article  includes a compilation of the concepts that the authors believe to be the core information systems knowledge that all business school students should be familiar with.

%X This paper focuses on Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) adoption in healthcare organisations. EAI has emerged to support organisations overcoming their integration problems, and it has been adopted by many sectors. Despite its importance, the healthcare sector develops EAI solutions at a slower pace and can be characterised as a laggard compared to other sectors. The small number of EAI applications in healthcare has resulted in limited research in this area, with many issues requiring further investigation. The normative literature analyses the factors that influence EAI adoption in healthcare but it has not yet explored the role of actors during the adoption process. This paper makes a step forward and contributes to the body of knowledge as it: (a) highlights the role of healthcare actors and attitudes towards EAI adoption; (b) introduces an actor-oriented approach; (c) identifies those actors involved in this process; and (d) combines the actor-oriented approach with the factors influencing EAI adoption. The authors believe that such an approach is significant and novel as it: (a) enhances existing EAI adoption models by incorporating an actor-oriented analysis; and (b) facilitates healthcare organisations in making robust decisions for EAI adoption. The authors discuss the application of their approach through a hospital case study. While a single case study alone cannot be proof, the engagement of the actors was encouraging.

%X Information systems security is a critical area of inquiry and closely allied with IT audit skills from the accounting discipline. While accounting scholars are well informed about IT audits, information systems scholars interested in the security aspects of IT audits sometimes lack knowledge about the process through which scholars and professionals become security and audit experts in order to assess the quality of information-security implementations. IT audit knowledge enriches cybersecurity professors for both teaching and research. Individuals skilled in accounting, such as graduates from combined accounting/information systems departments in business schools, are naturally oriented to industry certification groups and their professional certifications, but mainstream IT academics are not. In this paper, we report on a panel discussion at AMCIS 2017 that focused on how researchers and educators who seek professional certifications offered by organizations such as the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) can gain much richer knowledge of and insights into IT security assurance, which they can use for both teaching and research purposes. Such certifications provide valuable perspectives for the classroom and for research and are useful for IT professors interested in all aspects of security.

%X Zoorate emerged from its cofounders’ ambition to develop a Web portal for aggregating product reviews. The company’s core product, Feedaty, had evolved from a platform that matched reviewers by affinity into a full-fledged platform for aggregating and certifying consumer feedback. Specifically targeting online sellers and merchants, Zoorate continually increased its client based and signed up more than 1,000 customers by 2017. Supported by the strategic partnership and synergies with its shareholder 7Pixel Srl, the firm appeared to have finally set sail for success. However, several challenges lay ahead. The main competitors continued to grow in strength internationally and increasingly challenged Feedaty’s value proposition. How should Zoorate efficiently grow Feedaty? How should it deal with strong international competition that had begun to gain traction in Italy? Should the company continue to consolidate its Italian presence or expand abroad? The answer to these difficult questions would ultimately determine Zoorate’s future.

%X Since its founding in the 1960s, the Information Systems (IS) field has been involved in critical debates about the nature and future of the discipline.  Many researchers feel that diversity in IS research is our strength; others fear that too much diversity leads to losing the field's core identity. Do the scholarly contributions of the IS community reveal either of these two phenomena? In order to address this question, we examine articles published in leading IS journals (MISQ, ISR, and JMIS) during the period of 2000 to 2006. Our analysis includes classifying the articles using a classification scheme that includes the consideration of IT artifact, the research methods used, and the research topics covered. We provide descriptive statistics following a content analysis procedure and results based on cluster analysis and association rule mining. Our results provide an update on previous findings on IT artifact and its consideration in IS publications. Our results further suggest that while our leading journals cover a broad range of research topics and methods, there is also evidence of popularity on some topics and research methods.

%X This case study concerns moral conflicts identified by instructors on a project course in information systems education. Students on the course in question are expected to acquire project-work skills through implementing a project task for a real-life client. Data about moral conflicts was gathered by means of participant observation and interviews, and a phenomenographical approach was taken in the analysis. Six types of moral conflicts were identified, reflecting two aspects of the phenomenon. The first relates to conflicts involving outside parties and task-related and human issues and the second to deliberation about performing morally wrong acts or upholding relations. The core problem area in the instructor's work became visible in the form of inherent role strains and the need to react to conflicting expectations from all parties. The underlying source of the strains was the clash between the objectives of the clients and the learning aspect promoted by the university. This and three other types of strain made the instructor's work mentally demanding and morally challenging. Recommendations for dealing with these moral conflicts and role strains are given. Finally, the study is evaluated against the principles laid down for interpretive research.

%X Everybody wants to get a good review but not everybody is willing to give a good review. In my experience, this fact has resulted in a modern-day instance of “the tragedy of the commons” in which everyone seeks a precious common resource (in this case, the scholarship of peer review in scientific publication) but everyone less widely provides it. Editors face an emerging review culture in which many qualified colleagues often seem too busy, too disinterested, or simply too inaccessible to engage with for peer review purposes, and which leads to issues that are, indeed, tragic in the practice of science.

%X This case analyzes the complex interactions between firms in the interrelated areas of search engines and portals after the dot com crash of 2000. Overture, a 1998 start-up, had transformed the online advertising market through the innovation of paid search, in which advertisers bid for top position for search terms. These results were provided to the portals and appeared alongside organic search results when a search was done. But Overture became a victim of its own success as the portals used their audience control to gain a greater share of advertising revenues. Google entered the paid search market in 2002 which ultimately led to Overture losing its independence and becoming a Yahoo subsidiary in 2003. As Google grew rapidly and expanded into other markets Yahoo and MSN attempted without success to counteract its influence. By February 2008 Google had been the clear winner of this rivalry, with Yahoo severely weakened. This culminated in an attempted Microsoft takeover of Yahoo with the main aim of stopping Google, a development Google was determined to prevent. This led to Google cooperating with Yahoo on paid search and Microsoft subsequently withdrawing its bid in May 2008.

This presentation centered on the major changes to the IS Model Curriculum that is currently being proposed by the joint Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Association for Information Systems (AIS) task force. The goal of this task force is to provide the first major revision of the IS model curriculum since IS ’97. The major modifications to the IS Model Curriculum involve: 1) reaching beyond the business school to include programs housed in other parts of the university (e.g., health informatics); 2) revising the outcome expectations for the IS graduates and proposing subsequent changes to the curriculum topics; 3) revising the curriculum structure by separating the curriculum core from the elective topics; and 4) involving and making relevant the model curriculum to the global IS community. Also, this paper summarizes the key components to the restructuring of the IS Model Curriculum: high-level organizational needs for IS capabilities and graduate knowledge and skills. Finally, future steps in the curriculum revision process are discussed.

%X Scandals in corporate finance in the early 2000s and subsequent policy changes led corporate executives to adopt a more risk-based approach in corporate governance. Therefore, identification and assessment of risks became extremely important. Risk assessment poses a particular challenge for auditors due to the highly complex structure and processes of internal control systems. Extant research in this area mostly focused on probabilistic models and expert systems that capture and model heuristic knowledge. However, evidence suggests that knowledge of the structure of the internal control system is also essential. There is relatively little research that focuses on the modeling of the structural aspects of financial processes and their internal control systems as a means of helping corporate executives and auditors perform their respective tasks of risk management and assessment. This article proposes an approach to risk management and assessment in internal control systems that models the structure and financial processes of an internal control system. The model uses a directed graph to represent the various elements in an internal control system, such as financial statement assertions, control activities, financial processes, and the causal relationships that exist among these elements. The article demonstrates the usefulness of the model by presenting and discussing algorithms based on this model to help corporate executives manage risk and to help internal and external auditors assess risk, for designing substantive testing and for tracing sources of errors.

Not only do these platforms empower the patients by giving them complete control over their records, but they also can help promote the adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) by healthcare providers. In a pluralistic healthcare system like that which exists in the United States, where many healthcare providers lack the incentive to adopt EHR and electronically share their patients’ records with competing providers, we believe that PHR platforms can facilitate the adoption and use of EHRs in the healthcare sector.

It is a doctoral student's role to generate these ideas about thesis topics, about scope, and about methodology, but it is the advisor's role to recognize the good ideas from the "not so good" ideas, and to help the student develop and complete a doctoral thesis.  This paper explores the advisor's role in recognizing good thesis ideas.  One of Gary Dickson's greatest skills is his ability to identify and encourage thesis ideas that are of high quality and high potential impact.

%X From the perspective of a doctoral student, there are several inferences to be made from the "Is it MIS?" question.  First are inferences pertaining to the nature of MIS as a system (or set of systems) focusing on issues including purpose and boundary.  Second are inferences about the role and responsibilities of the individual researcher relative to the MIS community.  Third are inferences about science and the nature of inquiry.  This dimension considered, even if it is MIS, does it support MIS as a worthy component of a larger world of inquiry.  This article addresses these issues and concludes with some thoughts about Gary Dickson's contribution through this and similar questions on the MIS field.

At best, there is a correlation between the quality of a research paper and its being accepted for publication.  A research paper's becoming accepted for publication is ultimately a social process, which exists in addition to and is no less important than the content of the paper itself.  In this article, I examine how the social process can influence the crafting of a paper for submission to a journal, and re-crafting it in the event that the journal's editor asks for a revision.

%X Virtual worlds like Second Life offer players opportunities to earn real-world income through their activities in the game.  It will not be long before governments begin to establish policies and regulations regarding the income generated by players of these game environments.  This paper examines the issue of taxes in virtual world games.  Two alternative places for recognizing income could be established by regulators: 1) at the point when in-game transactions take place; or 2) when players convert game assets into real-world currency.  We argue for realization of income, and therefore taxation, at the exchange.  We expect that burdensome policies such as requiring game operators to monitor and report taxable activities to the authorities will dissuade game play and likely result in the collapse of these vibrant economies.   Therefore, our recommendation is that the IRS should establish specific rules that inform players about how they should calculate income and work with game operators to inform participants of both the rules and consequences for non-compliance.

Given the increased dependence of businesses on computer-based systems and networks, vulnerabilities of systems abound. Clearly, exclusive reliance on either the technical or the managerial controls is inadequate. Rather, a multifaceted approach is needed. In this paper, based on a panel presented at the 2007 Americas Conference on Information Systems held in Keystone, Colorado, we provide examples of failures in information security, identify challenges for the management of information systems security, and make a case that these challenges require new theory development via examining reference disciplines. We identify these disciplines, recognize applicable research methodologies, and discuss desirable properties of applicable theories.

%X There is a general need to understand better how context can affect evaluation, usage, and productivity of IT in research and practical settings. This paper investigates how perceived effectiveness of e-mail-style computer-mediated communication (CMC) differs between work and non-work contexts of use, and contrasts these differences with perceived effectiveness of face-to-face communication (FtFC). From the prior literature, we identified seven major activity domains that are prominent in CMC research. We developed a set of activity scales and corresponding measures of normative cognitive effort (NCE) for these domains and conducted an initial study to evaluate the overall instrument. In a second study, we measured perceived effectiveness of the communication mode within each activity domain among subjects who had communicated via e-mail and FtFC over a 15-week period. Some subjects communicated to support team-based software development (work context), and others communicated for personal interest (non-work context). We find communication technologies, activities, and contexts of use jointly determine perceived effectiveness; context influences perceived effectiveness primarily through interactions; and NCE successfully predicts perceived effectiveness based upon normative differences among activities. Our findings extend prior research in the area of task-technology fit to incorporate context effects, suggest that context is an important consideration in designing research, and introduce NCE as a method for predicting fit that can be applied even prior to system design. We conclude that the differential effects of work vs. non-work contexts are too large to be ignored, and we recommend an increased focus on context effects in CMC research and practice.

%X McBride (2018) worries that researchers increasingly approach information systems (IS) research like a natural science whereby they seek to develop general laws “by applying statistical surveys and running laboratory experiments”. While it is interesting to liken IS to the hard sciences, the discipline has deep interdisciplinary roots that join many ontological, epistemological, and even philosophical understandings of phenomena related to information technology (IT). These diverse viewpoints strengthen the discipline. They are healthy and beneficial for a discipline that studies rapidly moving, complex phenomena. Rather than turn away from rigorous, statistically intensive methods, we propose that IS researchers embrace diversity and adopt an entrepreneurial model of scholarship. By employing entrepreneurial mindsets to guide their selection of theories and methods, we believe IS scholars can create opportunities to conduct rigorous, relevant work that examines increasingly diverse, complex, and emerging IT-related phenomena.

%X In this commentary, we complement McBride’s (2018) paper by setting the debate in its historical context and building on the “rite of passage” notion that Chughtai and Myers (2017) introduced to denote the process of researchers entering a field of practice. We first summarize McBride’s (2018) main point concerning whether or not IS is a science and pick up on the systemic nature of IS. In doing so, we incorporate how researchers have historically treated the debate and distinguish science per se from the scientific method. We turn then to reflect on the point that this debate apparently refuses to die. We conclude with a forward-thinking section in which we consider the implications of our considering the topic not for the field as a whole but for individual IS researchers. We end with our own modest call for action in terms of focusing on the everyday practices of IS researchers— specifically, the rites of passage or transitions (and lack of them) we (should?) go through in how we practice our research.

%X Although multidisciplinary by nature, the Hawaii International Conference on Systems Sciences (HICSS) has established itself as the leading international conference in business intelligence (BI), business analytics (BA) and, more recently, big data research. Given a large number of academic and industry conferences in these areas, it is worth reflecting on and learning from the long tradition of BI and BA research at HICSS. In this paper, we analyze the 28-year history of HICSS’ longest-running minitrack on BI and BA in order to identify its main research themes and reflect on their evolution over time. Our insights provide research grounding for the current thinking about the big data phenomenon, which, contrary to many statements, is not new. We also illustrate a practical method of combining a semantic text-mining tool (Leximancer) and collaborative sensemaking. Reflecting on the method, we argue that technology itself—regardless of how sophisticated it might be—does not generate meaningful insights. Rather, we argue that domain experts co-construct these insights through an iterative collaborative sensemaking process in a given context, an important point that other researchers interested in semantic text-mining tools should consider.

%X In recent years, scholars’ interest in developing historically informed explanations of information systems has surged. Several scholars have suggested that doing so can help information systems scholars to examine shifts in the academic nature of our discipline, trace the origins of prominent information systems phenomena, and reflect on and critique their own work. To enable such inquiry, we draw on the theory of social representation to build an analytical tool, WikiGen, and develop a methodology for examining the evolution of collective knowledge on Wikipedia. We demonstrate the usefulness of the tool and methodology by applying it to an illustrative case study, the Wikipedia article on cloud computing. After presenting the results of the analysis, we discuss the applicability of the tool and methodology, the contributions of our study, and possibilities for future research.

A recent CIO roundtable composed of the CIOs of some of the leading corporations in Greater Detroit discussed the impact of these shifting boundaries on IT issues including outsourcing, careers, and employee development. Contemporary IT depends on external vendors, yet these relationships can be complicated. Employees are increasingly mobile, and the skillsets that firms demand are changing significantly. The panelists suggested that firms should focus on developing and engaging employees despite the risks of turnover.

Because these applications have substantial implications for users, organizations, and society, social networks (SNs) have gained attention from information systems (IS) researchers and grown steadily as a research area since 2004. However, to organize the accumulated research and encourage researchers to examine new and pressing issues in SNs, available knowledge needs to be synthesized and research gaps need to be addressed (Bandara et al., 2011). Therefore, we systematically reviewed publications about SNs published in major IS journals between January 2004 and August 2013 and, in this paper, overview the state of IS research regarding SNs. We show the evolution of the existing IS research on SNs to build a common nomenclature and taxonomy for this area of research, to identify theories used, and to provide a useful roadmap for future research in this area.

%X In the past several decades, and at an increasing pace, many records that used to be stored on paper have been stored digitally on computer information systems, instead. As older technologies are replaced by newer generations of hardware and software, new schemes for storing and coding the data are introduced.  Because of the rapid evolution of technology, future digital systems may not be able to read and/or interpret the digital records made and stored on these older systems, even if those records are still in good condition. We are losing the knowledge of how the old systems stored and coded information. Increasingly, therefore, when we attempt to access and recover those aging documents, we will find that we no longer have the necessary information to do that.  This paper addresses the problem of maintaining long-term access to digital documents and provides a methodology for overcoming access difficulties due to technological obsolescence. We created a model, called the Digital Rosetta Stone, that provides a methodology for maintaining long-term access to digital documents.  The underlying principle of the model is that knowledge preserved about different storage devices and file formats can be used to recover data from obsolete media and to reconstruct the digital documents.  We describe three processes that are necessary for maintaining long-term access to digital documents in their native formats--knowledge preservation, data recovery, and document reconstruction.

%X Increasingly organizations compete based on time. As a result, cycle-time reduction is a key agenda for organizations interested in achieving increased customer service and reduced cost. With improved cycle time, organizations can often eliminate or reduce inventory while expanding customer service offerings.  The purpose of this tutorial is to present the fundamental concepts of cycle time reduction and to show how IS can be used to reduce cycle time, increase customer service, and reduce costs significantly.  The tutorial examines several organizations that used IS as a way to leverage cycle time for competitive advantage.

%X Business process management (BPM) is a topic that has received immense attention in information systems research and practice. While the existing literature comprehensively covers BPM methods, techniques, and tools, the development of BPM capability in organizations remains under-researched. Existing studies mainly present maturity models with generic sequences of distinct stages that provide a rather simplistic perspective on BPM capability progress. Taking a process theory view and drawing from organizational change literature, we elaborate on alternate templates for explaining BPM capability development. By revisiting two case studies on BPM capability development, we analyze the explanatory power of four basic theories of capability development and thus advance existing approaches to explain BPM capability progress. Our analysis shows the general applicability of these theories and points to particular advantages, disadvantages, and application conditions. Using the four basic theories as alternate templates, we also offer a much more-detailed explanation of the mechanisms behind the episodes of BPM capability progress that we observed in the two case studies. In particular, the different theoretical templates allow one to better understand the influence of internal and external contexts on BPM capability progress.

%X Gathering insights on users and the contexts they use mobile applications is at the core of the user-centered design (UCD). Organizations find it strategically important to efficiently and effectively use these insights. With the proliferation of mobile applications, gaining timely and relevant insights is increasingly challenging due to the heterogeneous and dynamic context of use, the abundant availability of information on use behavior and the intense time constraints imposed by the highly competitive mobile market. This paper develops a research model that considers strategy foci as motivators that affect the efficient and effective use of insights on users and context in design practices. We examine the mediating effects of UCD resources, such as time and financial constraints, organizational practices, and UCD competence. To test the model, we conducted a survey with 100 mobile practitioners and used PLS to estimate the model. The model shows that focus on an innovation strategy both directly and indirectly affected data use on user and their context (i.e., mediated by organizational practices and UCD competence) in design practices. Strategies with a focus on cost had no direct effect on the use of user insights but led to negative impacts on UCD competence and organizational practices.

%X Passwords are the most widely used method of authentication on the Internet, but users find compliance with password guidelines difficult, and we know little about the long-term effects of attempts to improve compliance. In this paper, we extend the work of fear appeals use in the IS security domain to investigate their longer-term effects. We conducted a longitudinal experimental study to examine fear appeals’ long- and short-term effects. Using a model based on protection motivation theory (Rogers, 1983), we found that fear of threat, perceived password effectiveness, and password self-efficacy predicted compliance. We also found that neither perceived vulnerability to a security attack nor perceived severity of an attack influenced compliance. Providing persuasive communication improved compliance with password guidelines and resulted in significantly stronger passwords, but the effects on compliance intentions were only short term. This study extends our understanding of the factors that influence compliance with password guidelines and how we can modify them to improve compliance. We raise interesting questions about the role of fear in different IS security contexts. We also highlight the need for more research on the long-term impact of persuasive communication.

%X NeuroIS is a growing field that builds on neuroscience to improve the understanding of human interaction with information technologies and information systems. One can investigate causal relationships between brain activity patterns, cognitive processes, and behavior in a non-invasive way via using non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) tools, but researchers in the neuroIS community have yet to do so. We introduce NIBS, show how it can address caveats found in current research, describe the implementation of a NIBS protocol, and assess what these tools can bring to the neuroIS field.

%X In this exploratory study we investigate the relationship between information and communication technologies (ICTs) and country-level governance. We include in our framework the five factors of ICTs:  access, quality, affordability, applications and institutional efficiency & sustainability. Governance indicators include voice and accountability, political stability and absence of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and control of corruption. Using secondary data on ICTs and governance indicators for countries from the World Bank, and controlling for the wealth effect, our main multivariate result indicates that ICTs—with the exception of the institutional efficiency and sustainability factor—have a positive relationship with governance indicators. ICTs therefore, have the potential to promote good governance. We also find that accessibility is the most important ICTs’ factor to enhance governance. Our results are useful in shaping policy decisions involving the nature and extent of investment in ICT infrastructure at the country level.

%X Data-mining technologies are within the grasp of many organizations. Commercially available data-mining packages make it relatively easy for firms to transform their data resources into predictive models. Yet, despite technological advances, the precise manner in which data-mining output should be incorporated into an organization’s decision-making processes remains unclear. This paper attempts to clarify the role of data mining by situating it within the context of Simon’s model of decision making. We use a complex decision problem from the video game development industry to illustrate several practical challenges managers face when using data-mining output as a decision making input. We then show how some of these challenges can be overcome by incorporating data-mined predictive models into a conventional decision-analytic formulation of the problem.

%X While the important role of family carers has been increasingly recognized in healthcare service provision, particularly for patients with acute or chronic illnesses, the family carer’s information needs have not been well understood or adequately supported by health information systems. In this study, we explore the information needs of a family carer by analyzing the extensive online diary of a Vietnamese family carer supporting his wife, who was a lung cancer patient. The study provides a deep understanding of the information needs of the family carer and suggests a four-stage information journey model including identification, searching, interpretation and information sharing, and collaboration. A number of themes emerge from the study including the key role of the carer, information filtering by the carer, information sharing and collaboration, and  the influence of Vietnamese culture. The paper concludes with a discussion of the requirements for health information systems that meet the needs of family carers.

This study thus offers a profile of the post-installation reality that contributes to an understanding of the difficulties associated with ERP assimilation.

%X Personal health record systems are widely available and regarded as a key element in the push for electronic health records and the meaningful use of technology in medicine. However, the adoption and use of these systems has been much lower than anticipated. While research has investigated the reasons for this lack of adoption, we have no satisfactory answers. As such, we undertook a qualitative research study in a medical clinic setting to investigate them. We focused on identifying how the unique user groups who interacted with these personal health record systems viewed their use and impact. We specifically examined three different perspectives on these systems; physician, patient, and medical staff (e.g., nurses, receptionists). We found that personal health record systems function as boundary objects that reflect significantly different meanings to the various user groups who interact with them. Our results show that patients largely view these systems as non-essential adjuncts to their current care routine, physicians see the systems as tools, and medical staff members view them as an additional task or chore with questionable effectiveness. This new conceptualization of these systems as boundary objects has significant implications for their design and use.

%X Despite the recognition that information is a strategic asset for any state government, we lack research on the deployment and use of information systems in the U.S. state government context. Information systems are central for state agencies’ efforts to develop optimal responses to demands from their internal and external constituents. We examine how a specific IS asset combines with prior knowledge to influence organizational capabilities. We also examine the connection between organizational capabilities and the IS-enabled absorptive capacity of U.S. state IT departments from the perspective of IS employees. This study may help researchers and practitioners understand the role of IS assets in forming IS-enabled absorptive capacity in government organizations. We collected survey data from 417 government IS employees that represented 21 different states. The findings indicate that the role of an IS asset depends on the type of asset. Inside-out IS assets (ERP) moderate the relationship between prior knowledge and organizational capabilities, while outside-in IS assets (CRM) directly affect organizational capabilities. In addition, organizational capabilities can directly affect IS-enabled absorptive capacity in IT departments. This research increases our understanding of the influence of different IS assets on IS-enabled absorptive capacity in state government IT departments. We discuss limitations and directions for future research.

%X Interactions between systems are a necessity, a source of opportunity, and a source of difficulty and complication in building, implementing, and maintaining IT-reliant systems in organizations. This paper presents system interaction theory (SINT), a theory for analysis that covers almost all intentional and unintentional interactions between work systems that may be sociotechnical or totally automated. SINT is a broadly applicable theory that encompasses interactions between the types of systems that are central to the IS discipline. To minimize redundancy, this paper summarizes SINT immediately after introducing the research goal and, thereby, provides a context for the many distinctions and references that follow. A discussion of SINT’s domain and scope explains why SINT views interacting entities as work systems rather than as tasks, components, or software modules. The literature review positions SINT in relation to topics under headings that range from general systems theory and computer science to human computer interaction and organization science. Topics in SINT include relevant characteristics of systems and system interactions, purposes and/or causes of system interactions, system interaction patterns, direct effects of system interactions, responses to direct effects, and outcomes related to system interactions. The paper discusses a variety of potential contributions to theory, practice, and research.

%X Urban utility equipment and electronic goods manufacturers are experiencing profound challenges in this age of rapid technological change. Panasonic, Japan’s leading electronics company, has also recognized the limits of its traditional product manufacturing orientation and decided to enter IT-intensive town management in view of these challenges. It has advanced a new strategy for creating sustainable communities to encourage both stakeholders and local residents to get involved. Stressing sustainability, the strategy has adopted a long-term perspective (i.e., a 100-year timeframe). Significantly, it must provide values that foster community-based sustainability and adopt a business model that ensures the economic viability of both constructing the town and managing its ongoing services. As information systems play a big part in the provision of services in the new town, the strategy requires the linking of information with technology and social aspects, quite unlike traditional manufacturing, which is solely based on technology concerns. As part of its new strategy, Panasonic defined five prominent service areas (i.e., energy, security, mobility, wellness, and community). The company thought these areas would expand and generate new value and services throughout the strategy’s timeframe.

%X While Africa as a continent has experienced steady economic growth over the last decade, quality of life issues still plague much of the continent. The complexity of these problems requires intellectual capabilities to develop workable and sustainable solutions. Thus, facilitating doctoral education in less developed countries (LDCs) is an important and worthwhile undertaking. This paper tells the tale of how a simple case of serendipitous opportunity to facilitate a doctoral research seminar for an African university became a catalyst in securing the participation of several leading scholars to contribute to the seminar and grow their interest in contributing to doctoral education in LDCs. The seminar garnered strong positive reactions from the students who were spread across Africa and among the scholars who participated. We discuss the lessons we learned with a view toward providing a template for remotely delivering doctoral coursework in LDCs.

%X Business training and education are changing.  Organizations have experienced dramatic changes in their structure, competitive environment, and the demographics and demands of their employees.  As a result, organizations are seeking new and innovative ways to train employees.  At the same time the evolution of technology mediated learning tools (TML) has resulted in flexible, interactive, engaging, learning technology tools that promote experiential learning, analytical thinking and problem solving.  Simulation based technology mediated learning (SimTML) tools are gaining popularity in practice.  SimTML facilitates lifelike environments that utilize animated pedagogical agents (APAs) which employ nonverbal communication traits in their interaction with the user.  The effect is a lifelike, face-to-face interaction, between the user and the APA.  The result is a flexible, interactive, engaging, TML tool that promotes experiential learning, analytical thinking and problem solving.  This paper explores current SimTML technology, how we interact with learning technology, and provides selection and evaluation principles for organizations to use when evaluating SimTML tools for their own training programs.

%X This study examines the relationship between cognitive style (adaptors versus innovators) and the learning curve when implementing new information technology. Kirton’s proposition that adaptors and innovators find equally creative ways of solving problems based on cognitive preferences was tested using a longitudinal case study. Test subjects were paramedics from a large metropolitan area. Cognitive style of the paramedics was determined, along with their individual learning curve when transitioning from a paper medical record to an electronic medical record. Results indicate Kirton’s proposition of equal performance between adaptors and innovators was only supported during stable periods. There was no statistically significant difference between adaptors and innovators either before implementation of the new system or post-stabilization. However, following system implementation, adaptors and innovators differed significantly with regard to their initial change in task completion times, pattern of learning, and the number of days required to reach stabilization.

%X Our vision of distance learning—learning via virtually being there—challenges educators and technology designers to go beyond the dominant distance education vision of learning via structured isolation. Our vision builds on the best of the technology-enhanced classroom and distance education. Interactions among participants are not only asynchronous but also synchronous, not only one-to-one and one-to-many but also few-to-many and many-to-many, not only about academics but also about the person, and not only consisting of written words but also voice and video. Learning materials and activities are prepared in advance and spontaneously, scheduled and unscheduled, and text-based as well as based on sound and images. Our belief is that most learners benefit from “being there” in a class and that “virtually being there” should provide that same benefit. Important features of our vision that are currently challenging to realize are related to technology limits on sharing all participants’ video, audio, and screens. These and other limitations, which may be beyond our ability to recognize at the moment, will be overcome when visionary educators and technology designers collaborate to develop solutions that fully engage participants in learning and take us beyond what has been envisioned to date.

%X Despite the literature exploring the factors of adopting information technology (IT) applications for the logistics industry, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is still considered an innovative technology, because of its unique characteristics compared with other IT applications. To avoid the negative effects derived from careless IT investments, companies in Taiwan’s logistics industry must evaluate the factors that could affect the adoption of RFID prior to its introduction. This research employed encoding and utilized a questionnaire survey with the aim of assessing the factors that affect the adoption of this technology within the industry. Based on the results of discriminant analysis and verification, this investigation found that competition in the marketplace, pressure of transaction partners, suppliers’ industry environment, cost, integration of supply chain strategy, complexity of RFID, and mutual standard were among the critical factors. This research anticipates these factors as crucial and beneficial for the initial introduction phase of  RFID adoption.

%X A data storage grid (DSG) is under development for a federation of clinical sites to provide a cost-effective backup and recovery solution for their clinical images. Geographic separation provides fault-tolerance against localized disasters. Pooling of storage resources across organizations utilizes economies of scale associated with storage area networks. However, the control and administration of a DSG is now spread across multiple organizations increasing the complexity of deployment. Socio-technical issues specific to a DSG arise as there are now multiple stakeholders linked together in a network of new relationships. Agreement upon every relationship is necessary to determine service level agreements, security, and liability such as in the event of a security breach. Implications of socio-technical networks and stakeholder analysis on the operators, rather than the users, of an interorganizational DSG are discussed.

%X Despite wide agreement that we are in a service-dominated economy, there has been little movement toward treating service and service metaphors as core aspects of the IS field. This tutorial proposes that viewing systems as services is a potentially fruitful but generally unexplored approach for thinking about systems in organizations, systems analysis, and numerous applications of IT. An extension of past research in several areas, viewing systems as services proves to be an umbrella for developing new systems analysis and design methods, improving business/IT communication, and finding practical paths toward greater relevance and significance in business and society.

%X A significant part of information systems research studies people as a part of a system, organization, network, or community. Since this research focuses on data related to the interaction of individuals, focus groups can provide data that cannot be obtained through any other method. However, compared with the abundance of handbooks and guidelines on how to plan and conduct focus groups, little methodological literature is available on how to analyze focus group data. In this tutorial paper, we provide a systematic and integrative approach for qualitatively analyzing different types of focus group data (e.g., group level content and interaction data) for information systems (IS) researchers. While we focus on IS research, our framework is also relevant to other applied business fields.

%X In this paper, we explicate citizen science in information systems research. Citizen science in IS research is a partnership between IS researchers and people in their everyday lives. Citizen science projects in the IS field are defined by phenomenon that interest both citizens and scientists and by the intervention of citizens in scientific processes for the purposes of scientific literacy and a more informed citizenry. We make the case for citizen science as part of a movement in IS research towards societally impactful research at the confluence of human behavior, technology, society, and environmental sustainability. We discuss the origins of citizen involvement in science and contemporary notions of citizen science from sociological, natural science, and public policy perspectives to build a working definition for the IS field. We provide examples of how one can leverage citizen science in IS research and discuss larger ideas for the possibility of citizen science.

%X Many organizations still find it painful to implement an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. Although ERP projects are collaborative efforts that many separate organizations conduct, academic research has not investigated ERPs fully from this perspective. To identify the challenges in ERP development networks (EDNs), we carried out an interpretive empirical study by using grounded theory to analyze data. After identifying 10 EDN challenges and analyzing the associations between the challenges further, we constructed a model that explains the challenges in ERP development networks. Relationship conflicts (root causes) create or reinforce one or more operational problems (consequences). Changes in the EDN structure initiate or reinforce the other two types. Whereas the existing literature has discussed ERP challenges mainly separately, we offer a more profound explanation of how they emerge and interrelate. Our findings aid practitioners in recognizing and focusing on the root causes of challenges rather than firefighting consequences. The findings can provide useful insights into collaborative and dynamic environments where multiple organizations interact.

%X An organization’s culture plays a strong role in its creating new knowledge, but, as organizations become more dispersed and technologies more advanced, many come to rely on computer-mediated communication (CMC) for employees to engage in all levels of knowledge management. Researchers have conducted little work to understand the effectiveness of socializing via CMC on organizational creativity, particularly as it relates to organizational culture. Some organizations tend toward a group culture, while others lean toward a rational culture. We investigate how both face-to-face (FTF) and computer-mediated socializing influence the relationship between organizational culture and organizational creativity at each cultural extreme. We surveyed 186 knowledge workers to investigate these relationships. Organizational culture interacted with socializing such that creativity in rational cultures benefited from using CMC to socialize, while group cultures appeared to be agnostic to different socializing types.

%X The evolving role of knowledge in modern societies has spurred an interest in better evaluating knowledge creation capabilities of a variety of business, non-profit, national or multinational actors. Our field has extensively focused on reviewing knowledge management evaluation and implementation programs at the organizational level. In this paper, which stems from a tutorial presented at AMICS 2006 in Acapulco, we focus on the efforts undertaken by International Development Institutions (IDIs) to assess the role of knowledge as a driver of national wealth and economic development. This paper describes methodological frameworks - such as the "knowledge assessments" - used to evaluate a country's potential to generate new knowledge. Knowledge assessments comprise of qualitative and quantitative exercises to collect benchmarking data on relative national standing in knowledge endowment (the knowledge indexes). The review suggests some open issues and solicits enhancing the predictive capabilities of current models.

%X The need to teach e-commerce (EC) is a significant issue for academia. Regardless of the downturn in dot.com startups, many organizations are still very much aware of the need for effective EC strategies and applications. In response to industry demand, some universities across the globe have launched EC programs. Others implemented EC electives at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. This paper presents suggestions for teaching EC. Findings from a study of EC offerings by the top fifty UK business schools are presented. A wide disparity exists across schools in terms of EC offerings, including a significant number of schools that do not offer EC modules or degrees. This paper offers and discusses the following recommendations on how to implement an EC curriculum effectively and economically in a business school: 1. EC should be taught throughout the business school curriculum as part of traditional classes followed by EC specialty classes and practicum courses. It is essential that multiple departments invest in offering EC curriculum. 2. Foundation classes should be taught before EC specialty classes. 3. EC survey courses should not be taught early in the curriculum because they are difficulty to staff and maintain. 4. EC classes should be a balance of each discipline's fundamental principles, along with some newer EC theories and applications. 5. Principles taught in Information Systems classes can have broader application when patterns are taught that span many technologies instead of teaching only specific applications. 6. It is important to leverage alumni and industry volunteers to help provide EC lecture series and for input on EC curriculum and teaching.

%X This article presents a model for Internet portal management. The model allows portal implementers to monitor and reflect on their portal implementation process and to identify appropriate strategies to improve their community building efforts. The portal management model (PMM) is a lifecycle model that contains four stages. Each stage is identified and described by a number of characteristics and an associated existential crisis. Each crisis must be addressed for the portal to remain in business but it must be overcome to move on to the next - more advanced - stage. Four competitive strategies are presented as effective for steering the portal through each of the stages. At the initial stage, the new portal should seek to be the unavoidable pesky little brother and seek to imitate the older established portals. At the second stage the appropriate strategy is for the portal to gain strength through marriage rather than staying single - called the battle of the sexes strategy. At the third stage it is time to take firm control over the portal community. Here open confrontation is unavoidable as in the fairytale of Tweedledum and Tweedledee. At the fourth and final stage, the established portal must ceaselessly monitor the market for new contestants and counter them.

%X America faces an internal challenge to its position as a global leader in information technology.  This challenge is real, and it impacts the core of this country's historical greatness - the preparedness of the national workforce.  Simultaneously, the 21st century worker is facing a dynamic environment where technology and workforce diversity are key drivers for organizational change.  The skilled workforce of the future must identify and evaluate opportunities and risks, leverage knowledge competencies, and effectively integrate information in a manner that creates value for their organizations.  This study examined whether re-designing business curricula to incorporate culturally relevant business cases would be effective in increasing the number of underrepresented groups in the IT workforce.  We used five undergraduate courses at a Historically Black University to examine students' technology awareness, technology integration capabilities, and attitudes towards IT career opportunities.  Overall, the findings indicate positive changes in students' technology integration skills. Additionally, students' technology awareness increased, but changes in their attitudes towards IT careers were not significant.

%X User profiles, which personalize applications, are an important factor in designing on-line computer systems. This study targets user profiles to better understand the interactive process of users and consultants in social science research studies. Definition of such profiles should be a basis for designing an electronic consulting system. The results of an empirical survey of both users and statistical consultants are presented. Questionnaires and interview were used to identify the different perceptions of using statistics, analysis tools, typical hypotheses, interpretation of results, and related topics.   The findings shed light on the users of statistical systems and the role of the consultant in supporting the conduct of a research study. We found that the majority of users possess only a basic course in statistics, find difficulty in stating their problem, and two-thirds of them use consultants to define and design their study. The implication for an electronic consulting system are that such systems should pay attention to the initial research problem definition and should use a system-initiated question/answer approach to elicit problem information from the users.   Based on the findings, design guidelines are presented for an electronic consulting system that can bridge the gap between the user and the wide range of statistical methods available in commercial packages.

A significant aspect of web side design is the set of choices for traversing from one web site page to another and the ramifiations that these choices have for establishing the overall flow patterns throughout the web site. This study establishes a taxonomy of web site traversal patterns and structures which will allow the organized study of the navigational aspects of web site design.  It also points out the ramifications of key structures.  Finally, it describes how the use of traversal patterns and structures can achieve web sites that range from loose to tight control of the end user's experience in visiting the web site.

%X The term theoretical lens has grown in usage in business and social science research and particularly in the information systems (IS) discipline. In this paper, we question what the term really means by examining it on several dimensions in the context of its actual use. In particular, we consider 1) where the term appears in each paper, 2) how many conceptualizations of theoretical lens each paper uses, 3) the research method the paper uses, 4) the IS domain the paper considers, and 5) which underlying conceptualizations the paper actually uses. To do so, we examine the full set of actual uses in the IS journal that uses the term most frequently, the European Journal of Information Systems. We conclude by discussing several further questions that these observations raise, which suggest deeper issues about better and less advantageous uses of theoretical lenses in IS research and what these issues might imply for the IS discipline.

%X The development and sale of massively multiplayer online games has emerged as a significant part of the 21st century entertainment industry. Yet, firms competing in this sector of the videogame industry vary in their ability to generate revenue from their products. We contend that social influence constitutes one primary factor that determines which massively multiplayer online game individuals consume. Using social identity theory for our theoretical underpinning, we argue that the identity that membership in important social groups provides influences individuals. We investigate the effects that two identity-related constructs, consumer-brand identification and social identity complexity, have on satisfaction and willingness to pay a subscription fee for a massively multiplayer online game. Our results suggest that social influence has a complex relationship with an individual’s willingness to pay. Consumer-brand identification and social identity complexity had significant direct relationships with willingness to pay, while consumer-brand identification had a significant indirect relationship with willingness to pay through satisfaction. Additionally, social identity complexity significantly moderated the relationship between consumer-brand identification and willingness to pay. Overall, our results support social identity theory’s ability to explain how social influence occurs for individuals that play massively multiplayer online games.

%X Today, many countries around the world focus on ensuring that all people can access health services of sufficient quality without experiencing financial hardship (i.e., universal health coverage). To measure progress towards this goal, countries need to build robust health information systems. Because countries need to root universal health coverage in primary healthcare, they also needs to sensitively anchor health information systems that support universal health coverage in existing routine health information systems. However, doing so involves significant challenges, which we study via empirically analyzing an Indian state's effort to implement a universal health coverage health information system in primary healthcare. Using a theoretical lens informed by institutional theory, we seek to answer the question: “What is required to develop institutions that support the use of new technologies and associated work processes that universal health coverage entails?”. We identify the contradictions that emerge when new systems clash with existing ones, and we discuss what implications such contradictions have in terms of system design, work processes, and institutions. We contribute to the literature by explaining inherent complexities in universal health coverage health information system design and implementation and providing system design guidelines.

%X Organizations have increasingly begun to co-create innovations, conduct idea competitions, or conduct crowdsourcing initiatives with customers in online communities. Yet, many customer-integration methods fail to attract sufficient customer participation and engagement. We draw on previous research to identify customers’ experience as an important determinant of whether customer-integration initiatives succeed. However, research has rarely applied the notion of experience in the context of customer integration. We conduct a cross-disciplinary literature review to identify the factors that constitute a positive customer-integration experience and the implications of the customer-integration experience. Based on 141 papers from marketing, technology and innovation management, information systems, human-computer interaction, and psychology research, we derive a framework for customer-integration experience that integrates 22 conceptually different influencing factors, 15 implications, and their interrelatedness based on motivation-hygiene theory. The framework sheds light on the current state of research on customer-integration experience and identifies possibilities for future research.

The panel explored a research agenda on IoT technology and its interaction with business and society. IoT refers to the ever-growing number of numerous physical devices that feature software and location-based technologies that connect together in a network and exchange data with one another. IoT has garnered significant attention in information systems due to its rapidly expanding market and demand from a wide range of stakeholders such as consumers, businesses organizations, and government agencies. The IoT may be the next industrial revolution in which interconnected physical devices will automate skills and tasks. In today’s hyper-connected economy, IoT can radically transform businesses and society through increased transparency, optimized production processes, and decreased operating expenses. Overall, the panel identified a six-pronged IS research agenda for IoT that comprises the IoT’s impact on business and society, IoT monetization and end-user services, the IoT as a distributed platform, the convergence of the IoT and blockchain, security concerns and solutions, and the IoT and ethics. The paper concludes with a future direction for IoT.

The case asks students to assess the risks and potential rewards of enterprise sourcing alternatives for the Fijian retailer. The case sensitizes students to the organizational, environmental, and technological issues that this business faced, such as unreliable and expensive electricity and broadband Internet. Students who reside in developed countries often take some of these issues for granted, and, thus, the case challenges them to consider a broader global context and question the conventional wisdom of solutions such as cloud computing and ERP packaged software benefits for small- and medium-sized businesses.

His 50 years of knowledge builds on experience from companies in the United States and Asia, both large corporations and start-ups, and for-profit and nonprofit companies. Additionally, he has helped develop the minds of generations of business leaders through his work at the Harvard Business School (HBS). Through the years, he has developed and taught IS case studies on companies that range from Chase Manhattan Bank to Alibaba. Given his enduring work in technology, these interviews provide interesting insight into coursework development at HBS, the frequent redefinition of the digital native, the language of business versus that of IT, a management stance on IT, the management of IT projects, work on for-profit and nonprofit boards, and a view on China and IS.

%X FROM THE PREFACE TO THE CASE STUDY: In July 1998, Hurley Myers, President of DxR Development Group, stared at the gray plastoid brain lying on the desk before him. A prop for the medical multimedia software his firm developed, it also was a suitable metaphor for the many critical decisions that he faced. Complicating these decisions was his uncertainty regarding the intentions of his partner and biggest customer, a large pharmaceutical company. For the next six months, the customer had the option either to buy DxR out or to release it from its contractual obligations. If it chose the former, it might do so just to obtain the intellectual property rights controlled by DxR. This option might permit DxR to start up again in the medical education marketplace, but without its biggest customer and much of its intellectual property. With either the restart or release option, DxR would need to adapt to the major change in orientation. The change would encourage DxR to identify new customers and new product opportunities and create new strategic alliances. If any of these options resulted in further growth, Myers knew that some of his management team felt more rigorous procedures were necessary for software development and human resource management. Myers also felt that DxR's pharmaceutical partner needed to be making greater use of the Internet for marketing, and perhaps distributing, DxR's products.

%X Organizations use enterprise architecture (EA), which describes an enterprise from an integrated business and IT perspective, to improve business and IT alignment. The literature describes many different methodologies to organize EA practice. However, organizations typically adapt these EA methodologies to their specific needs rather than use them directly “out of the box”. As a result, actual EA practices often differ substantially from the original EA methodologies. Unsurprisingly, establishing a successful EA practice remains troublesome even though multiple detailed methodologies exist. However, researchers have yet to investigate the adaptation of EA methodologies in organizations. In this paper, based on an in-depth qualitative case study, I explore the adaptation of the most popular EA methodology, TOGAF, to address this gap. In this paper, I holistically describe a TOGAF-based EA practice and analyze the adaptation of the TOGAF methodology in an organization. From my findings, I conclude that none of the TOGAF-specific recommendations proved useful in the studied EA practice. Supported by ample indirect evidence available in the existing EA literature, this study questions the value of TOGAF as a standard for EA practice. Moreover, the studied EA practice hardly resembles any established EA methodologies or theoretical conceptualizations. Therefore, the EA practice that this case study describes presents a new, largely unexplored empirical phenomenon. Although this study raises multiple “inconvenient” questions challenging the status quo in the EA discipline, it does not provide definite answers to most of these questions, which calls for further research on methodological aspects of EA practice.

%X A prominent bank in India has swiftly and consistently lost market share for a high-revenue product. It has diagnosed poor communication with customers as the underlying cause. As such, it has begun to contemplate whether to direct its resources towards analytics and digital advertising channels or to continue to improve its current advertising techniques that revolve around mass marketing initiatives and its large network of branches. The case expects participants to evaluate the costs and benefits of alternatives available to the bank and propose a comprehensive customer-acquisition strategy to address the crisis. We write the case in the form of a roleplay, which participants in class can enact to boost their interest and involvement in it.

%X Researchers have long studied the prevalence of poverty and inequality throughout the world. Much of this poverty has resulted from a lack of opportunities for socio-economic growth and development. In this commentary, we conjecture that bridging knowledge disparities through mass education would reduce wealth and income disparities. Specifically, we investigate whether educating underprivileged individuals (who otherwise would have little access to education) via an inexpensive tablet device would bring about access to digital content and social networks and, thus, result in development opportunities for them. We draw from lessons from the pathfinding one-laptop-per-child (OLPC) initiative and several other field experiences. Through adopting a method of dialectic enquiry that Alan Turing first posed in his seminal investigation into whether machines could replace people, we first pose arguments against our postulate and then consider opposing points of view. Specifically, we address: what are the positive and negative effects of the BYOD approach to learning? How does the BYOD approach bridge knowledge disparities across the socio-economic divide? What impact does the BYOD approach have on different forms of student engagement? Are the digitally less connected also less literate? We conclude with some thoughts on whether content and devices should or could replace teachers.

%X The paper presents the report of a panel that debated the review process in the information systems (IS) discipline at ICIS 2017 in Seoul, Korea. The panel asked the fundamental question of whether we need to rethink the way we review papers in the discipline. The panelists partnered with the audience to explore some reviewing limitations in IS today and the ways that reviewing in the discipline might change to address some of its difficulties. We first report key concerns with modern reviewing. We then present arguments for and against three proposals (i.e., paying for reviews, mandatory reviews, and open reviews) and a panel audience vote on the issues. We neither advocate for nor condemn these solutions but rather use them to illustrate what we believe represent the core underlying issues with reviewing in the IS discipline. Specifically, we believe the key stumbling blocks to effectively improving our review process include 1) a lack of empirical data on actual practice, 2) a lack of clear goals, and 3) an ignorance of the possible solutions to the review dilemma that the wider literature articulates.

%X This paper reports on the panel discussion that took place at the European Conference on Information Systems (ECIS) in Guimarães, Portugal, on 9 June, 2017. The discussion focused on three central questions: 1) “What does research impact mean for you?”, 2) “What is your approach to making an impact with your research?”, and 3) “What advice would you give to PhD students and early-career scholars?”. While the five panelists (Samir Chatterjee, Alan R. Dennis, Shirley Gregor, Magnus Mähring, and Peter Mertens) partly differed in their views on what impactful research is and how to conduct it, they seemed to largely agree that assessing impact requires a multidimensional view, that impactful IS research requires a clear link to real-world problems (“grand challenges”), and that young scholars need to avoid the trap of confusing research gaps with research relevance. With the panel discussion and this report, we hope to initiate a discussion on the essential topic of research impact in the IS discipline and to contribute to the development of a more uniform, yet more diverse, understanding and appreciation of different approaches to making an impact with IS research.

%X Given the global growth in ransomware attacks, employees need to understand the risks of ransomware and how to protect against it. This paper presents a teaching case based on an actual ransomware attack on a hospital that undergraduate or graduate course can use to teach students. The case introduces students to Wildcat Hospital, a fictitious 450-bed acute-care facility in a suburban location in the Northeastern United States. A ransomware attack hit Wildcat Hospital as the workday began. Malware infected the hospital's computers and demanded one bitcoin, a virtual currency that affords anonymity, as ransom to restore functionality of the information systems. The chief executive officer and the chief information officer led the organizational response to the attack. We include links to two videos, a demo of a Locky ransomware attack in action, and a National Broadcasting Company (NBC) TV network news report about a similar ransomware incident at another hospital (Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in California) to engage students.

While the number of data science programs continues to increase, few discussions have examined how we should define this emerging educational field. With this in mind, during the 23rd Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS’17), a panel discussion explored emerging questions regarding data science and analytics education. This paper reports on that panel discussion, which focused on questions such as what a data science degree is and what a data science program’s learning objectives are. The panel also debated if there should be different types of data science-related programs (such as an applied data science program or a business analytics program) and, if so, should there be a common core across the different variations of programs. Information system educators who can gain a better understanding of current trends in data science/analytics education and other information system researchers who are interested in how data science/analytics might impact the broader field of information systems and management education should find interest in this report.

%X In this paper, we investigate how members’ participation in off-topic social forums in electronic networks of practice (eNoPs) influences their propensity to participate in their domain-specific forums. Currently, the literature offers two theoretical arguments that would predict opposing outcomes concerning the impact that off-topic forum participation has on domain-specific forum participation. We argue that investigating the network structure of the off-topic forum has the theoretical flexibility to reconcile these opposing theoretical arguments. Specifically, we hypothesize that an off-topic forum’s overall network structure (network cohesion as determined by the global clustering coefficient) moderates the impact of off-topic forum participation on domain-specific forum participation. We theorize that, given equal conditions, off-topic forum participation creates social bonds that positively affect domain-specific forum participation when the off-topic forums have a highly cohesive network structure. Contrarily, however, we posit that off-topic forum participation becomes a noisy distraction when the off-topic forum has a less-cohesive network structure. We provide empirical support for these hypotheses via a 10-year longitudinal study of software developers’ participation in an electronic network of practice (eNoP). Our paper highlights new theoretical insights on the network effects in an eNoP whereby network structures in one section (off-topic forums) have ramifications for behaviors in a different section (domain-specific forums).

%X Employees increasingly complete organizational tasks using privately owned consumer technologies such as private devices (e.g., smartphones) or private Internet accounts (e.g., email accounts). Higher satisfaction constitutes a major reason for this bring-your-own behavior (BYOB). However, little research has theoretically explored and empirically tested this assumption. This study sheds light on this phenomenon by analyzing the effect of BYOB on IT satisfaction. Drawing from social cognitive theory, we propose choice self-efficacy as a new construct that intermediates the relationship between BYOB and IT satisfaction. Building on results from survey data (n = 400), we provide new evidence that BYOB has a positive effect on IT satisfaction whereby choice self-efficacy plays a vital element as it mediates this relationship. Since IT satisfaction shapes how people use technology and how they perform with it, we derive important implications for future research on IT consumerization. Furthermore, we provide several conclusions for practitioners and discuss how to enhance IT satisfaction and choice self-efficacy.

%X Developing and advancing theory in the information systems (IS) discipline requires scholars to use and contribute to theory. While few IS scholars create new theories, many borrow and adapt theories from other disciplines to study a variety of phenomena in the realm of IS. Over time, this practice has raised concerns as to the appropriateness and quality of theories adapted in the discipline. In particular, this practice causes issues when one considers conflicting results from many studies that claim to leverage the same theoretical foundation. We examine the issues surrounding theory adaptation in IS and provide a set of integrated theory adaptation guidelines to help scholars successfully and reliably adapt theory. We illustrate how one might use our guidelines via using Protection Motivation Theory in an organizational information security setting.

%X Unified modeling language (UML) is widely taught in the information systems (IS) curriculum. To understand UML in IS education, this paper reports on an empirical study that taps into students’ learning of UML. The study uses a concept-mapping technique to identify the challenges in learning UML notational elements. It reveals that some technical properties of UML diagrammatic representation, coupled with students’ cognitive attributes, hinder both perceptual and conceptual processes involved in searching, recognizing, and inferring visual information, which creates learning barriers. This paper also discusses how to facilitate perceptual and conceptual processes in instruction to overcome learning challenges. The study provides valuable insights for the IS educators, the UML academic community, and practitioners.

%X Past research has mainly focused on defining information systems (IS) skills and competencies at the industry or global level; it has offered little guidance on best practices for managing IS at the organization level. And yet, a resource-based view indicates that failure to properly manage skills and competencies could lead to suboptimal outcomes such as a loss of IS process knowledge and innovation, an inability to adequately evaluate vendor performance, and a lack of critical skills and competencies needed to meet future demands. In this paper, we examine how one government agency managed its systems for testing personnel. We describe the need for a process to assess IS skills and competencies in order to analyze the gaps and ensure they are filled. A concrete understanding of existing gaps guides sourcing of skills and competencies through hiring, training, internal transfers, and work allocation. This paper presents an effective methodology for this purpose.

%X Lurking just under the surface of longstanding debates about rigor versus relevance and about the core and scope of the IS field is the question of whether inadequate definitions of basic terms is an obstacle to progress. This article focuses on whether the definition of IT artifact or work system really matters. It identifies five definitions of IT artifact and IT-enabled work system, and then looks in detail at whether the definition of work system mattered in Jasperson, Carter, and Zmud's [2005] article in MIS Quarterly about post-adoptive behaviors.  It argues that their definition perhaps affected their conceptualization of post-adoptive behaviors. It presents an alternative model illustrating how a different definition and greater attention to work system issues might have led to a different conceptualization that addresses different issues.

%X Several theories of E-Democracy have been presented, and implementations of and experiments 	in E-Democracy emerged. However, existing literature on the subject appears rather non-comprehensive, lacking an integrated basis, for gathering knowledge in the future. After an analysis of theories of E-Democracy versus implementations reported in related literature, we address the need for a model generally absent from contemporary theoretical literature: the Partisan model of E-Democracy. We aim to simplify the current "jungle" of E-Democracy models into four idealised models: the Liberal, the Deliberative, the Partisan, and the Direct. We aim to illustrate how current theories of E-Democracy, in addition to reported implementations, may be covered by these models.  The explanatory potential of these four models is illustrated by analysing implementations of a communication technology for E-Democracy, the web-based discussion forum. We argue that, instead of viewing technology, such as the Internet, as a "black box," any implementation of E-Democracy should be adapted to the specific democracy model(s) pursued by a particular initiative. In addition, E-Democracy researchers could be more specific about their standard of democracy, in order to avoid artificial comparisons or criticisms of contemporary E-Democracy without an explicit framework of criteria. Finally, we discuss the possibilities of unifying the ideals from different models on E-Democracy. We suggest that any context of E-Democracy may in fact require elements from all four models to stay dynamic over time.

%X The disaffection of information technology managers with IT strategy development and planning goes back a long way. The research that identifies this dissatisfaction is examined briefly.   The technology strategy and planning problem is shown to be multi-faceted, with several possible causes that may be operating simultaneously in a particular company.  A major ingredient of the problem is the alignment/linkage of IT planning and plans, and the business plans.  For IT planners to achieve the desired linkage requires that the planners possess a deep understanding of their company's business planning.  Similarly, business managers must possess solid knowledge of their company's IT planning.  Using Kiviat Diagrams, business planning approaches are shown to be bewildering in their variety. This variety indicates that IT planning managers must find it difficult to decipher business planning in general and the nature of their company's business planning in particular.  Nine approaches to plan alignment and linkage are explored, each with respect to its possible value for linking IT planning and plans to business planning and plans.  The development of a Theory of Plan Linkages is proposed.    Several sources of the problem are suggested, and several IT management approaches to IT planning are explored briefly.  It is unlikely that any single set of IT planning activities can deal satisfactorily with the problem for most companies.   Efforts are proposed for developing best practices for IT planning.  Steps are proposed for use by IT planners to improve their company's IT strategy development processes.  Areas that merit further academic research are explored.

Further, we contend that a pure OO curriculum involving OO languages and OO analysis and design is advisable in our efforts to equip our students with the knowledge to be successful as software developers. We offer ways to transition to a curriculum that emphasizes the OO philosophy of development.

%X The software analysis process consists of two main activities: data modeling and functional modeling. While traditional development methodologies usually emphasize functional modeling via dataflow diagrams (DFDs), object-oriented (OO) methodologies emphasize data modeling via class diagrams. UML includes techniques for both data and functional modeling which are used in different methodologies in different ways and orders. This article is concerned with the ordering of modeling activities in the analysis stage. The main issue we address is whether it is better to create a functional model first and then a data model, or vice versa. We conduct a comparative experiment in which the two opposing orders are examined. We use the FOOM methodology as a platform for the experiment as it enables the creation of both a data model (a class diagram) and a functional model (hierarchical OO-DFDs), which are synchronized. The results of the experiment show that an analysis process that begins with data modeling provides better specifications than one that begins with functional modeling.

This essay argues for the IS field to forge its own unique disciplinary subject matter by synthesizing the diverse discourses of its "reference disciplines" and not by merely drawing from them.  Using examples of other established disciplines with equally multidisciplinary origins, this paper analyzes the history of the IS field to uncover the field's subject matter.  The proposed subject matter maintains the IS field's richness and diversity without losing its unique identity.

%X The Internet-enabled connectivity has created opportunities for businesses to conduct various forms of collaborative activities. However, the findings of several surveys indicate that the deficiencies in data quality might compromise the potential benefits of joint efforts. Global data synchronization (GDS), the process of timely updating product data to maintain the data consistency among business partners, is viewed as the key to materialize the benefits of e-collaboration in the global supply chain setting. In the paper, we present the need for data synchronization, discuss the evolution of technical standards of data identification schemes, and introduce the Global Data Synchronization Network (GDSN), the platform on which global data synchronization is substantiated. We detail the structure of GDSN and the protocols for the process of GDS. Furthermore, we discuss business and management implications of GDS, different approaches to implementing GDS, and challenges to the implementation of GDS. The emergence of GDS and GDSN presents research opportunities on issues relating to the implementation of GDS, the relationship between GDSN and EPCglobal Network, the impact of GDS on inter-organizational relationships, the network effect of global standards, and evolution of complementary standards. We discuss these research opportunities. In brief, the article covers the history, present status, and future of GDS and GDSN, as well as their potentials, benefits, and implementation issues.

%X This study examines a critical incentive alignment issue facing FS-ISAC (the information sharing alliance in the financial services industry). Failure to encourage members to share their IT security-related information has seriously undermined the founding rationale of FS-ISAC. Our analysis shows that many information sharing alliances’ membership policies are plagued with the incentive misalignment issue and may result in a “free-riding” or “no information sharing” equilibrium. To address this issue, we propose a new information sharing membership policy that incorporates an insurance option and show that the proposed policy can align members’ incentives and lead to a socially optimal outcome. Moreover, when a transfer payment mechanism is implemented, all member firms will be better off joining the insurance network. These results are demonstrated in a simulation in which IT security breach losses are compared both with and without participating in the proposed information sharing insurance plan.

%X The use of technology in health care settings is an area of increasing interest to information systems researchers. An awareness of journals and conferences that focus on this innately interdisciplinary field is necessary if researchers in related domains, such as information systems, intend to connect methodologies, insights, and perspectives to advance health IT knowledge. This study fills a void in the literature by providing an initial peer ranking of dedicated health informatics journals and related conferences as guidance for those interested in learning more about and/or publishing in this field. Results indicate that there are at least forty-five journals that researchers may want to consider in conducting health informatics work.

%X Stakeholders, both internal and external, can have differing and sometimes conflicting perspectives and priorities even though each has a vested interest in organizational success. Using the lens of stakeholder theory, we examine the differing views of stakeholders (namely, medical providers and vendors) in the implementation of electronic health record (EHR) systems. The implementation process itself can be broken down into three phases: pre-implementation, during implementation, and post-implementation. After determining a comprehensive set of seventeen key issues relevant to each phase, we discovered that there are significant differences in the perceptions of EHR vendors and their customers in terms of which issues in each phase of an EHR implementation are most important. These findings indicate that vendors tend to underestimate the role of nursing staff and that providers tend to underestimate the role of security. Both groups, however, agree that physician support throughout the implementation is essential for success.

%X Studies often show that mid-career faculty are some of the unhappiest people in academia. Many mid-career faculty have tenure, have more freedom to pursue different types of projects, and have many options ahead. Yet, mid-career faculty members also deal with the personal politics that arise during the tenure process, with figuring out what to do with the newfound freedom, and with finding their own way among the many options in an academic career path. As a junior faculty member, one often has a singular goal: obtaining tenure. However, mid-career faculty members need to concern themselves with not only becoming a “full” professor but also figuring out what to do once they have reached that milestone and feeling full in their overall career path. In this paper, we discuss the challenges associated with being a mid-career faculty member based on research and insights discussed in the mid-career workshop offered at the Americas Conference on Information Systems. We offer examples of how to support mid-career faculty through workshops and mentoring relationships. We also provide insights on how individuals at different career stages can support and understand the challenges among mid-career faculty in information systems.

However, there is a lack of empirical research to explain Green IT capabilities of organizations and the maturity of those capabilities. This article reports a Green IT Readiness framework to capture the input, transformational and output capabilities that organizations need to nurture in sustainable management of IT. It identifies five components of G-readiness and provides an exploratory framework and a research-ready instrument. The instrument is validated based on data collected from a cross-sectional and cross-country survey of IT managers.

%X The entity-relationship model has long been employed for conceptual modeling of databases. Methodologies and heuristics have been developed, both for effective modeling and for translating entity-relationship models into relational models. One aspect of modeling that is often overlooked in design methodologies is the use of optional versus mandatory participation (i.e., minimum participation) on the development of relational databases. This tutorial complements existing instructional material on database design by analyzing the syntactic implications of minimum participation in binary, unary, and n-ary relationship sets and for the special case where the E-R diagram depicts a database where 3NF is not in BCNF. It then presents design modeling guidelines which demonstrate that (1) for binary 1:1 and 1:M relationship sets, the presence of optional participation sometimes means that the relationship set should be represented in the relational model by a separate relation, (2) unary relationship sets cannot have a (1,1) participation, (3) n-ary relationship sets that have a (1,1) participation can be simplified to be of lower connectivity, and (4) decomposition is not a substitute for normalization. Illustrative examples and modeling guidelines are provided.

%X When a bank or a credit union turns you down for a loan because your debt-to-income ratio is too high, can you turn to total strangers to get the money? Yes, you can, and we are not talking about criminal acts. It's called peer-to-peer (P2P) lending or social lending. Prosper was the first company to take the vision of social lending and convert it into practice on the Internet in the United States, and it enjoyed fast growth after launch. Four years later, however, it is facing old and new challenges, and its survival is on the line. This case depicts the opportunities and pressures Prosper faced, its actions and reactions, and its future. Prosper has made and will make many important decisions, and Prosper’s successes and challenges are rich material to study.

%X Despite significant attention given to effects of early exposure on acceptance and adoption of new systems, there continues to be ambiguity regarding its effectiveness beyond a threshold. For organizations concerned with optimal utilization of IT resources, a deeper understanding of ideal levels of early system exposure can result in greater realization of benefits through enhanced design of system training and mitigation of adverse effects of exposure on adoption. In this article, we propose that the relationship between system exposure and acceptance can demonstrate diminishing gains—as early exposure to a system increases beyond a reasonable level, its acceptance declines. Preliminary findings from an enterprise-wide system implementation suggest that exposure through pre-launch system trials results in diminishing system acceptance beyond an optimal point. We draw on learning and response-stimuli literature to interpret this early evidence. The article concludes with research propositions, recommendations, and implications for practice.

%X An important organizational trend is the practice of offering IT services via a shared services model. A shared services model is attractive to IT organizations, as it promises benefits due to centralization and/or consolidation of similar activities across the organization. For the business, a shared services model is attractive because it frees up resources by transferring responsibility for a noncore activity to another organizational body. Based on a focus group of senior IT managers from leading organizations, this article examines the current practice, in particular the reasons for adopting an IT services model, how IT shared services are structured, challenges during implementation, and benefits derived from this model once implemented. The article concludes with suggested strategies for organizations interested in creating an IT shared services organizational model.

%X Social commerce is a form of commerce mediated by social media and is converging both online and offline environments. As a relatively new phenomenon, social commerce has evolved quickly in practice, yet has gained little attention in the IS discipline. With its pervasiveness in businesses and people’s lives, social commerce presents ample research opportunities that can have both theoretical and practical significance and implications. This article aims to capture researchers’ attention by describing the characteristics of social commerce and its potential future directions. We trace the evolutionary patterns of social commerce chronologically, based on trade articles and academic publications from 2005 to 2011. A framework that combines people, management, technology, and information dimensions is used to provide a systematic analysis of social commerce development. Our examination shows that since 2005, the year the term social commerce was incepted, assumptions and understanding of people in social commerce move from a simple and general description of human social nature to a rich exploration with different angles from social psychology, social heuristics, national culture, and economic situations. On the management dimension, business strategies and models evolve from the short-tail to long-tail thinking, with invented concepts such as branded social networks/communities, niche social networks/communities, niche brands, co-creating, team-buying, and multichannel social networks. Technologically, IT platforms and capabilities for social commerce evolve from blogs, to social networking sites, to media-sharing sites, and to smartphones. While Facebook becomes a profit-generating platform, creating the notion of f-commerce, Google and Twitter become strong competitors with great potentials. Information in social commerce evolves from peer-generated, to community-generated (crowdsourcing), to consumer and marketer co-created, and to global crowdsourced. Our examination identifies various conceptualizations, terminologies, views, and perspectives about social commerce and its relation to other well-known concepts such as e-commerce. In light of the evolution of social commerce, we provide possible future directions for research and practice.

%X During the past few years, Web 2.0 applications have changed the Web from a search tool to a platform for collaboration. Research has also started to show that Web 2.0 applications promote organizational knowledge sharing and creation. There is not, however, a comprehensive conceptual framework that explains how the organizational use of Web 2.0 leads to organizational learning. In this article, we develop such a framework by drawing on social capital theory, the SECI knowledge creation model, and the concept of Ba to show how the dimensions of social capital that emerge from the use of Web 2.0 applications evolve and drive organizational learning.

%X At the 2007 Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS), panelists discussed a continuing research project about the current IT workforce and future trends, presenting the latest results of an international Web-based survey. The project is sponsored by the Society for Information Management (SIM) International Advocacy Program and consists of two phases.  The initial phase was a study of workforce trends in IT client companies and was completed in 2006.  IT executives from client firms say it is critical to own business and project management capabilities, and they especially value them in their mid-level hires.  Technical capabilities are more likely to be externally sourced, but they are also sought in entry-level hires.   The second phase is a study of trends in service provider companies and is ongoing. Our preliminary results indicate that provider firms also value project management and business domain capabilities over technical capabilities.  In the panel, we compared the Phase 2 (provider) results to the Phase 1 results from client organizations and discussed the implications of the data for curriculum design, hiring and training practices.

%X The recent debate about crisis in the Information Systems (IS) discipline is largely attributed to its having a fluid discipline identity. Myriad conceptualizations of IS discipline identity have resulted in a plethora of unstructured and disconnected recommendations for the survival and growth of the IS field. It is therefore essential to have a theoretical framework which explains: What is IS discipline identity? In this study, we address this void in the identity literature. By extending and borrowing from the concepts of organizational and self-identity, we propose a theoretical framework for discipline identity and explicate its dimensions with respect to the IS discipline.  The three contextual questions of discipline identity about purpose, period, and place set the stage for an in-depth inquiry of the three constitutive questions (or dimensions):  periphery, perspective, and process, to provide a holistic framework for conceptualizing IS discipline identity. Further, we conceptualize IS discipline identity process as consisting of four recursive and iterative sub-processes: copy, consolidate, differentiate, and demonstrate (CCDD). We posit that an iterative hermeneutic focus on these four sub-processes is vital for the health of the discipline and neglecting even one of them will lead to an imbalanced identity structure. Through this paper, we seek to stimulate and further the ongoing debate on the topic.

%X The fundamental function of information technology (IT), whether internal or external, is the cost-effective provision of IT services that meet organizational needs and align with organizational strategy. With ever-increasing adoption of IT management "best practices," industry now leads the academic community by recognizing the need for IT professionals educated in the IT service management (ITSM) processes -- processes directly associated with the delivery of high-quality, cost-effective IT services.  This article presents a summary of  panel member presentations and subsequent discussions at Americas Conference on Information Systems  (AMCIS) 2007 concerning the need to, and means for, incorporating ITSM concepts into business-school MIS/IS/CIS curricula.  Panel members from industry strongly advocated the importance of including ITSM principles and concepts within business-school IS curricula.  Academic members of the panel also articulated this need and described initiatives at their and other schools where ITSM concepts have been or are planned for inclusion in business school curricula at both the graduate and undergraduate levels.  ITSM research opportunities, faculty preparedness, and possible resistance from within the IS academic community were additionally addressed.

%X The shrinking student numbers in IS programs in developed countries has created a crisis for the IS profession. In this paper, we explore how offshoring is affecting the IS discipline both directly and indirectly and show some of the major causes behind the relocation of IS work. Our primary message is that while offshoring has impacted the location of some IS tasks, this has not led to the demise of the field. Indeed, in contrast to the public conception, the statistics show there are more IS jobs now than ever before in developed countries. We explore what can be done to better prepare the field for the offshoring challenge and to align the rather negative public perception of the future of the IS field with reality. While simple IS tasks such as coding can be commoditized and are therefore vulnerable to offshoring, other significant pieces of IS work (e.g., business modeling/IS business analysis) are "customer-facing" with high levels of complexity. The latter are less vulnerable to commoditization and consequently less likely to be offshored. We recommend that the academic IS community focus more on producing these customer-facing IS personnel that organizations will increasingly look for. We offer some suggestions for stakeholder groups in the field to address the key challenges they face.

%X Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) has started to revolutionize the way today's organizations do business. Since its highly publicized adoption by Wal-Mart, several companies have started using RFID in their supply chains with varying results. On the academic level, many new research streams have been launched concerning the applications of RFID in business. However, whether or not the academic community is ready to adopt this technology itself remains a question. To consider the future of this technology in research and industry alike, the authors organized two panels on the topic of the promise of RFID technologies at the 2007 Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS) held in Keystone, Colorado. They also demonstrated the capability of the technology using a proof-of-concept pilot system as a means for providing added services to conference attendees. This article reports on the two panels, as well as on the results from the pilot experiment.

%X Recent developments in the field of integration technologies like Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) have emerged to support organizations towards improving the quality of services and reducing integration costs. Despite the importance of EAI, there is limited empirical research reported on its adoption in the healthcare sector. Khoumbati et al. [2006] developed a model for the evaluation of EAI in healthcare organizations. In doing so, the causal interrelationship of EAI adoption factors was identified by using fuzzy cognitive mapping. This paper is a progression of previous work in the area and seeks to contribute by validating the model through a different case environment. Thus, this paper contributes by deriving and proposing the MAESTRO model for EAI adoption. MAESTRO identifies a set of factors that influence EAI adoption and it is evaluated through a real-life case study. It provides an understanding of the EAI adoption process through its grounding on empirical data. In doing so, the MAESTRO model supports the management of healthcare organizations during the decision-making process for EAI adoption.

%X Despite the growing number of organizations that have lost track of their application landscape and have suffered from a sharp increase in application portfolio complexity, a comprehensive and systematic approach to Application Portfolio Management (APM) still appears far from being adopted. To move the adoption process along, this paper develops a comprehensive framework assimilating and extending previous research and presents an APM process comprising data collection, analysis, decision-making, and optimization phases. This paper also presents an approach for evaluating software tools for APM and identifies which software tool families are best able to provide support for specific purposes. With this integrated conceptual guideline for APM and its translation into a model for measuring appropriate practical support, this paper not only allows for a move more deeply into the research area but also offers advice for both researchers and practitioners.

%X APM is the ongoing management process of categorization, assessment and rationalization of the IT application portfolio which allows organizations to identify which applications to maintain, invest in, replace, or retire. To understand current APM strategies and practices, the authors convened a focus group of senior IT managers from a number of organizations. Results of the focus group discussion pointed to the need to develop three inter-related APM capabilities: (1) strategy and governance, (2) inventory management, and (3) reporting and rationalization. To deliver value with APM, organizations must establish all three capabilities. Experience suggests that organizations tend to start by inventorying applications and work from the “middle out” to refine their APM strategy (and how it is governed) as well as to establish efforts to rationalize their applications portfolio. As such, APM represents a process of continual refinement. Fortunately, experience also suggests that there are real benefits to be reaped from the successful development of each capability. The paper concludes with some lessons learned based on the collective experience of the members of the focus group.

%X Managing changing business environments and requirements in Information Systems (IS) development is becoming increasingly important. IS development project courses could thus benefit from the infusion of agile, flexible, and adaptable processes. This article reports two years of continuous effort in refining the IS development project course in the National University of Singapore to illustrate how undergraduate students could be effectively taught the agile IS development approach. The course design process was based on the system approach model to instructional design and followed the principles of instructional events suggested by Dick and Carey [1991] and Gagne et al. [1992]. Input from students, as well as pedagogic principles drawn from the extant literature, were used to rigorously refine the course design over time. The final course design exhibits five distinctive characteristics. The two most important characteristics were (1) the adoption of a hybrid agile methodology incorporating the best practices in both coding and project management drawn from three established agile methodologies, and (2) the introduction of requirement shocks at appropriate junctures to train students to react to changes in business requirements. The effectiveness of the course design was assessed using objective measures of learning operationalized as the numerical scores obtained by students. Statistical analysis results indicate that the students who were taught using the final course design obtained higher scores than those who were taught with the initial design. Our course design effort was, therefore, deemed successful.

%X Recent years have witnessed rapid developments in e-government as well as e-business within nations across the world. Although both e-government and e-business contribute toward national economic performance, few studies have analyzed the two jointly in a single research model. Using the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework and the literature on information and communication technology (ICT) impact; we empirically examine facilitators of e-government and e-business development, the relationship between e-government and e-business, and their collective impact on national economic performance. Our results, which emphasize the differential importance of factors associated with the development of e-government and e-business, can be used by national policy makers for designing effective ICT policies. Specifically, national ICT infrastructure appears to be important for both e-government and e-business. Quality of national human capital emerges as a significant facilitator for e-government but not for e-business, whereas national environment (institutional and macro-economic) appears to be the key enabler for e-business, but not for e-government. Our findings demonstrate the significant and intertwined roles of e-government and e-business in enhancing the national economic performance. With a view to enhancing national economic gains, this research suggests that policy makers should consider measures to enhance development of e-government and e-business collectively rather than in silos.

%X The AIS/ISWorld Mailing List is the premier global communication tool for academics in the information systems area. This paper employs content analysis of archival data to report on an exploratory study of the usage of ISWorld over a four-year period between 2002 and 2006. We develop a coding scheme based on two theoretically distinct levels of communication and examine how ISWorld community members use the mailing list for the purposes of information dissemination, knowledge exchange, and knowledge creation. Our analysis yields important insights regarding the evolution of the ISWorld Mailing List, user characteristics and communication patterns, as well as the alignment between the community’s stated organizational goals and the design of the communication tool. Our findings show that the ISWorld Mailing List offers a highly efficient communication tool for knowledge dissemination to the IS community but also that its usage has been shifting more strongly towards information broadcasting and away from interactive knowledge exchange and creation. The paper concludes with some design and governance related recommendations for making ISWorld a more effective communication tool for the IS community.

%X Existing approaches to formulating IS security strategy rely primarily on the risk management process and the application of baseline security standards (e.g., ISO 27002, previously ISO 17799). The use of existing approaches generally leads to measures that emphasize target hardening and incident detection. While such measures are appropriate and necessary, they do not capitalize on other measures, including those that surface when situational crime prevention (SCP) is applied to specific crimes. In particular, existing approaches do not typically surface measures designed to reduce criminal perceptions of the net benefits of the crime, or justification and provocation to commit the crime. However, the methods prescribed to-date for implementing SCP are cumbersome, requiring micro-level, individual analysis of crimes. In the current article, we propose that concepts derived from SCP can be strategically applied at an intermediate (meso) level of aggregation. We show that such meso-level application of SCP, when combined with the traditional risk management process, can reduce residual information security risk by identifying new strategies for combating computer crime. Using three illustrative cases, we demonstrate that the application of the proposed strategic approach does surface meaningful countermeasures not identified by the traditional risk management process alone.

%X IS 2010 is the latest in a series of model curricula for undergraduate degrees in Information Systems. It builds on the foundation formed by this earlier work, but it is a major revision of the curriculum and incorporates several significant new characteristics. IS 2010 is the third collaborative effort by ACM and AIS. Both organizations have worldwide membership, and, therefore, IS 2010 includes elements that make it more universally adaptable than its predecessors. IS 2010 is not directly linked to a degree structure in any specific environment but it provides guidance regarding the core content of the curriculum that should be present everywhere and suggestions regarding possible electives and career tracks based on those.

%X Internet banking in Jordan has developed rapidly since the year 2001, as most Jordanian banks have adopted some form of Internet usage and launched websites to serve their customers. This study extends the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) by adding perceived facilitating conditions and personality dimensions, two factors that have been suggested as important determinants of technology adoption. The frame of the study was “counter bank customers” sampled in three banks from three major cities in Jordan. The results indicated partial support for the UTAUT with respect to the predictors’ effect on behavioral intentions. The extended model supported the influence of performance expectancy, social influence, self-efficacy, perceived trust, and locus of control on the individual’s intentions to use Internet banking. Implications for research and practice, limitations, future research, and conclusions are discussed.

%X Ever since Odysseus, King of Ithaca, left to fight in the Trojan War and entrusted his friend, Mentor, to care for and educate his son, academic mentors have guided, educated, trained, and encouraged protégés in their academic development. As with Mentor and his protégé, mentoring relationships evolve over time in a predictable pattern and certain behaviors are necessary to initiate and sustain a mutually beneficial mentoring relationship. There are numerous parallels between successful mentoring behaviors in the academic and business world, and this paper seeks to leverage those similarities to provide advice for academic mentors and their protégés. This paper describes the stages of a mentoring relationship, discusses behaviors that underlie each stage and presents a series of best practices that future academic mentors and protégés should seek to emulate. While specific activities vary by stage of the mentoring evolution, mentors and protégés should create successful relationships, be respectful of time expectations and demands, ensure that necessary advisement occurs, and be open to an increasingly deep and personal relationship.  By understanding and applying these behaviors, academic mentors and protégés can learn from and extend the mentoring legacy of Gary Dickson.

IRSS is defined as Involvement-Regimen-Self Management-Social activities intended to delineate and advise newly-minted doctorates into the professoriate. Boice's framework fosters the establishment of professional support initiatives warranted for career progression and is critical as neophytes to the field attempt to balance the three pillars often characterizing academic life: teaching, research, and service. Though Boice [1992] centers his research in the context of actions and behaviors of newly minted doctorates and others [Payton et al. 2005] examined those forthcoming to the professoriate, this article focuses on how Gary W.

%X Some researchers have compared the information systems discipline with the physical and biological sciences, which suggests that information systems sits in the same academic space as the physical and natural sciences. Indeed, the language and perceptions expressed in journals such as the Transactions for Replication Research, which refer to “scientific consensus” and the involvement of information systems researchers in “the quest for scientific advancement”, supports this suggestion. In this paper, I argue that the view that information systems is a science in which general laws can be developed by applying statistical surveys and running laboratory experiments has negatively affected the development of the discipline. I argue that the discipline’s nature is such that one cannot pitch it as a science. After briefly discussing the motivation and philosophy that might underlie the perception of information systems as a science, I offer an alternative view of information systems as a deep, complex, and multi-layered discipline in the humanities. I propose dance studies as an appropriate discipline to twin with information systems.

%X Despite the growing interest in enterprise architecture management, researchers and practitioners lack a shared understanding of its applications in organizations. Building on findings from a literature review and eight case studies, we develop a taxonomy that categorizes applications of enterprise architecture management based on three classes of enterprise architecture scope. Organizations may adopt enterprise architecture management to help form, plan, and implement IT strategies; help plan and implement business strategies; or to further complement the business strategy-formation process. The findings challenge the traditional IT-centric view of enterprise architecture management application and suggest enterprise architecture management as an approach that could support the consistent design and evolution of an organization as a whole.

%X This paper examines the conflict between anonymity and security in the context of new innovations that leverage the Internet. Anonymity affords an opportunity for the marginalized to express opinions without fear of persecution or discrimination; however, anonymity also facilitates crime and fraud. Its antithesis, traceability, is meant to deter malicious behavior, but can also be used by governments to control and persecute their populations. The debate between anonymity and security on the Internet is intricately intertwined with  threats to domestic and international security. As we launch into the implementation of the Smart Grid, arguably the largest engineering project of modern times, it is time to reexamine the fundamental premises on which the Internet was constructed. A single Internet may no longer be able to handle the conflicting demands of different applications. A new Internet with rules that balance security and anonymity may be appropriate for Smart Grid and other similar critical infrastructure projects. I present the rationale of rethinking the design of the Internet that simplifies its architecture, reduces its complexity, and removes vulnerabilities that have been exploited persistently. I also discuss some of the current trends, especially those related to standards and guidelines on Smart Grid privacy and security.

We define research impact as conducting research that makes a difference to individuals, businesses, industries, and societies. While assessment groups like the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) want scholars to make an impact, sometimes they operationalize impact in ways that may encourage scholars to pursue research goals tangential to making a difference. With this paper, we hope to stimulate thinking in the IS community on creating research assessment techniques that encourage our scholars to make a difference.

%X Formative modeling of latent constructs has produced great interest and discussion among scholars in recent years. However, confusion exists surrounding researchers’ ability to validate these models, especially with covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM) techniques. With this paper, we help to clarify these issues and explain how formatively modeled constructs can be assessed rigorously by researchers using CB-SEM capabilities. In particular, we explain and provide an applied example of a mixed-modeling technique termed multiple indicators and multiple causes (MIMIC) models. Using this approach, researchers can assess formatively modeled constructs as the final, distal dependent variable in CB-SEM structural models—something previously impossible because of CB-SEM’s mathematical identification rules. Moreover, we assert that researchers can use MIMIC models to assess the content validity of a set of formative indicators quantitatively—something considered conventionally only from a qualitative standpoint. The research example we use in this manuscript involving protection-motivated behaviors (PMBs) details the entire process of MIMIC modeling and provides a set of detailed guidelines for researchers to follow when developing new constructs modeled as MIMIC structures.

%X Financial services technologies (FST) are core to the continuous transformation of financial services organizations (FSO). To date, however, there has been a lack of empirical research into FST adoption against the backdrop of the recent financial crisis. In this paper, we re-examine how FSO are currently positioned to take advantage of emerging FST. Note that, in this paper, we look forward rather than provide a commentary on the state of the art in technology adoption research. We conducted this research by applying an exploratory qualitative study method: we analyzed interview transcripts from thirty recent interviews of FSO technology executives and CIOs by using a thematic network analysis tool. This analysis uncovered nineteen basic, eight organizing, and two global FST adoption research themes along with their links to FST adoption objectives, challenges, customer centricity, human resources, outsourcing, and overall IT strategy maintenance. This research has both practical and theoretical research implications and serves as a resource base for FSO and researchers to set future research priorities and directions. We intend for the emerging themes that we present in this paper to facilitate research directions by shedding light on the areas of greatest value and potential return in FST adoption.

%X IS master’s program curricula around the US vary, but are loosely based on the work that resulted in the MSIS2006 curriculum (Gorgone Gray, Stohr, Valacich, & Wigand, 2005). The recommendations, while well constructed, did not completely meet the needs of the Master of Science in Information Systems (MSIS) program at the Kelley School of Business, Indiana University. In this paper, we present a case study describing how IS faculty, considering local requirements and guiding principles, designed a unique and innovative integrated core curriculum for our MSIS program similar to those used in MBA programs. The design, described in detail, included innovations in faculty collaboration, integrated pedagogy across topic modules, and scheduling. Positive feedback from students and faculty confirmed the expected outcome of students’ connecting the dots between concepts and enhanced learning around the soft skill dimensions, such as teamwork. Our contribution to the IS academic community is in the design and execution of such a curriculum block, one that focuses on providing a balance between the technical and managerial aspects of information systems while also integrating soft skill development into the curriculum.

%X The online peer-to-peer lending marketplace has experienced rapid growth since its inception in 2005. It has played a significant role in helping small and micro-enterprises resolve financing problems. However, this marketplace is still in its infant stage. To better understand the lending activities associated with peer-to-peer lending, we need theoretically grounded empirical research. In this study, we investigate the perceptual drivers of online lending from the perspective of lenders. We empirically test our research model with survey data collected from 217 lenders in a major online peer-to-peer lending website in China. Our results reveal that trust was the most critical determinant of willingness to lend. Perceived information quality was important in mitigating perceived risk and enhancing trust, and perceived social capital impacted trust in borrowers. Furthermore, perceived risk did not significantly influence lending willingness, but had a negative impact on trust. These findings indicate that transaction behaviors in the peer-to-peer market may not be the same as that in the purchase-oriented e-commerce settings. We conclude by discussing the study’s implications for research and practice along with the its limitations.

%X In this paper, we present a multi-layered communication (MLC) model that includes a trust-constructing procedure that can be used to explain how rumors spread and stop over social media. We define two structures in our MLC model: the social structure (SS) in the social layer, and the communication structure (CS) in the communicating layer. We propose two trust-building mechanisms (TBM): the social-based TBM (SBTBM) and the communicating-aimed TBM (CATBM). We discuss the trust-constructing procedure to demonstrate that an individual will sequentially decide to spread information based on three factors: the opinion environment, the individual’s social influence, and the cost to confirm the information. The model predicts that individuals will tend to create links with others in social layers to extend their social structures (social clustering principle) when they use social media. Thus, a rumor will spread because a spreading core is formed in the CS. However, a rumor will be stopped by interactions that occur in the SS. Our empirical case supports this prediction. We analyzed the topology of CS to indicate how a spreading core forms and CS evolves, and how a rumor stops spreading because social behaviors in SS encourage the development of more accurate information based on reality.

%X Streamlining the operation of the extended global supply chain is challenging since it involves a multitude of information systems and companies in several countries. Academia partly fails to fulfill the demand for candidates with the knowledge and skills for executing international business transactions. Consequently, we lack candidates who can translate theory into actions, thereby creating a knowledge-doing gap. This paper contributes to bridging this gap by introducing a new learning activity: the global supply chain learning activity denoted as the GSC-Activity. The GSC-Activity lets students execute export and import transactions in an international business-to-business environment involving several companies while handling both the inter-company order flow and the internal order management cycles at each company using their ERP system. This provides student with deep exposure to the information flow along the chain and experience in executing export and import processes of each company. We provide a workable example of the GSC-Activity with a case study repeated over several semesters involving students from Australia and Norway.

%X Organizational and technological systems analysis and design practices such as process modeling have received much attention in recent years. However, while knowledge about related artifacts such as models, tools, or grammars has substantially matured, little is known about the actual tasks and interaction activities that are conducted as part of analysis and design acts. In particular, key role of the facilitator has not been researched extensively to date. In this paper, we propose a new conceptual framework that can be used to examine facilitation behaviors in process modeling projects. The framework distinguishes four behavioral styles in facilitation (the driving engineer, the driving artist, the catalyzing engineer, and the catalyzing artist) that a facilitator can adopt. To distinguish between the four styles, we provide a set of ten behavioral anchors that underpin facilitation behaviors. We also report on a preliminary empirical exploration of our framework through interviews with experienced analysts in six modeling cases. Our research provides a conceptual foundation for an emerging theory for describing and explaining different behaviors associated with process modeling facilitation, provides first preliminary empirical results about facilitation in modeling projects, and provides a fertile basis for examining facilitation in other conceptual modeling activities.

%X Business intelligence (BI), “big data”, and analytics solutions are being deployed in an increasing number of organizations, yet recent predictions point to severe shortages in the number of graduates prepared to work in the area. New model curriculum is needed that can properly introduce BI and analytics topics into existing curriculum. That curriculum needs to incorporate current big data developments even as new dedicated analytics programs are becoming more prominent throughout the world. This paper contributes to the BI field by providing the first BI model curriculum guidelines. It focuses on adding appropriate elective courses to existing curriculum in order to foster the development of BI skills, knowledge, and experience for undergraduate majors, master of science in business information systems degree students, and MBAs. New curricula must achieve a delicate balance between a topic’s level of coverage that is appropriate to students’ level of expertise and background, and it must reflect industry workforce needs. Our approach to model curriculum development for business intelligence courses follows the structure of Krathwohl’s (2002) revised taxonomy, and we incorporated multi-level feedback from faculty and industry experts. Overall, this was a long-term effort that resulted in model curriculum guidelines.

%X Insightful histories of an academic field can only be written when there is sufficient raw material to serve as “grist for the mill” for historians. This is the first task for those who are monumentally interested in preserving the origins of a field from the ravages of time is to collect artifacts—written, verbal, visual, and physical—that can later be used in historical inquiries. But the critical perspective to know what to collect and how much to collect is served by historiography, the science that elaborates on the variety of methods and procedures that historians use.  A simple but incomplete set of these variations include: political history, intellectual history, cultural history, and social history. Each of these viewpoints brings with it a different set of assumptions about what is important and, although there is considerable overlap among them, each brings a different set of requirements for artifactual evidence. Historiography should not be overlooked when the field of information systems begins an all-out effort to collect data about the history of the field.

Although all majors in a business school are typically required to take the foundations of IS course, its real or perceived value to businesses and future employers is unclear. A first step in evaluating the entire curriculum is to focus on the foundations of IS course. Results differ among the stakeholders, and discussions highlight the need to continually improve the curriculum to fit the needs and the assigned importance of the diverse stakeholders.

%X This paper introduces a comprehensive information system for supporting maritime traffic and commerce and explores the information systems related research opportunities associated with this system.  The paper begins by reviewing the existing dominant technologies deployed in the maritime environment: VHF Radio, Radar and GPS.  Next, the paper describes a comprehensive system called the Automated Identification Systems (AIS) that is being proposed by the maritime industry, military, government, and The International Maritime Organization.  A deployment scenario highlights how such a system could have unintended consequences if not carefully designed and deployed.  The paper concludes by briefly examining several information systems related research opportunities surrounding the design and deployment of the AIS. Given that little research is leading the design and deployment of the AIS, and given the critical role the worldwide maritime industry plays in commerce, this paper provides a foundation for others to begin the examination of this important area.

%X The work system method is a broadly applicable set of ideas that use the concept of "work system" as the focal point for understanding, analyzing, and improving systems in organizations, whether or not IT is involved. The premises underlying this method may be controversial in the IS community because they imply that the traditional jargon and concerns of IS practitioners and researchers address only part of the issues that should be covered and may discourage focusing on other core issues related to successful projects and systems.  The work system method includes both a static view of a current (or proposed) system in operation and a dynamic view of how a system evolves over time through planned change and unplanned adaptations. The static view is based on the "work system framework," which identifies the basic elements for understanding and evaluating a work system. This framework is prescriptive enough to be useful in describing the system being studied, identifying problems and opportunities, describing possible changes, and tracing the likely impacts as those changes propagate to other parts of the system. The dynamic view is based on the "work system life cycle model," which shows how a work system may evolve through multiple iterations of four phases. The static and dynamic views are used together in a principle-based systems analysis method that treats the information system as part of the work system until a final step when it distinguishes between work system changes that do and do not involve the information system.

%X This paper describes the logical evolution of IT service provisioning through various delivery models over time concentrating on the "rent" era as well as the "market" era - an emerging external IT services marketplace that offers rich opportunities for IT organizations to become more cost-effective in the future. With the market era, IT organizations speculate that strategic business applications for mission-critical applications will remain in-house but delivery for standard and meta-industry applications, processes, and technology will be off-site. Thus, for most companies, it is likely that external IT providers will form part of their future service delivery package and that some IT departments will become both consumers and sellers of components. The implications of these developments for IT management are articulated and the elements of an IT sourcing strategy presented.

%X Discussions of conceptual modelling assume that notation details are of secondary importance, a matter of taste and past experience rather than of science.  For example, it does not really matter if cardinality is shown with a 'crow's foot' or with the symbol '1..*'.   This paper argues that such an assumption is wrong and that the notation is extremely important in the process of modelling relationships because of the normative language that the notation specifies.  Normative language is shown to be a useful way of understanding and comparing relationship notation.  Barker's practical relationship definition, using a formal notation, is shown to be sufficiently well formed to allow the modeller to make sense of the domain in their own linguistic context.  Less formal notations are shown to disadvantage the less experienced modeller

%X The issue of whether firms are receiving an adequate return on their investment in information technology (IT) continues to pervade managerial decision making. While productivity and other financial metrics are established hallmarks of IT investment evaluation, research has called for broader and richer metrics that can take into account the diversity of IT impacts. In this paper, we extend previous instrument development research to develop and test a process-oriented thermometer of IT business value using survey data based on executives' perceptions of IT impacts at multiple points along the value chain. Consistent with earlier research, we find that our process measures are sensitive to differences in industry, firm size, and business strategy. Through additional analysis of post-implementation reviews of IT impacts in four firms, we find consistency of within-firm perceptual measures among teams of senior executives, highlighting the potential for our thermometer to gauge the level of IT impacts within a single firm. We conclude that process-oriented perceptual measures can offer new and useful insights into IT impacts, complementing what we already know from firm-level objective metrics.

In some cases, instructors supplement this traditional approach with written case studies and projects. In this tutorial, we present a non-traditional approach that could be used to communicate technical, as well as non-technical, concepts to IS students - use of multimedia instructional materials. This article also provides practical advice on how to adapt and implement pedagogy that includes multimedia instructional materials in MIS classrooms. The instructional materials include multimedia case studies that communicate concepts such as choosing appropriate operating systems for specific purposes; understanding Internet and satellite technologies; and decision support and expert systems used to solve real-world problems. The purpose of this article is to present a step-by-step tutorial on using multimedia instructional materials in a typical IS class.

Based on data describing organizational e-mail exchanges, this research deals with organizational structure, personal power, and the centrality of people in a network. Social network analysis is used to study the centralization dimension of the structure embedded in the data. The data concerns 385 employees of 36 firms within a group. Our empirical study first explores several possible assessments of power and centrality concepts; then, it tests a causal relationship between personal and organizational attributes of power and centrality indexes. Results show the relationships between personal characteristics, aspects of organizational power, and e-mail network centrality. A discussion of the way managers may use electronic communication data to better interpret the nature and the dynamic of the organizational structure concludes the article.

%X In September 2004, the State of Colorado implemented a large information system it called the Colorado Benefits Management System (CBMS). Its purpose was to replace six aging legacy systems supporting various state-administered welfare programs with a single system using current technologies. The expected benefits from CBMS were better service to clients and assurance that the state’s welfare programs were being administered properly. The conversion was a disaster, and, as of early 2011, CBMS is still not working properly. Since 2004, there have been a series of promises and attempts under two separate administrations to fix CBMS so that it meets performance requirements. Nothing has worked. This case chronicles events since late 2006 until early 2011. It lays the groundwork for class discussion of how and why public sector managers could fail to focus on fixing the problems with CBMS for almost seven years, and now will simply “kick the can down the road” to the new administration that took office in January 2011.

%X Despite growing interest and attention from Information Technology researchers and practitioners, empirical research on factors that influence an organization’s likelihood of adoption of Web services has been limited. This study reports an empirical analysis of survey data to identify the influencing factors and demographic characteristics related to Web services adoption intention—based on whether to adopt and when to adopt Web services—from the perspective of 129 South Korean firms. The survey questionnaire respondents were an individual in each firm who typically advised the key person who would be making the decision to adopt Web services technology. The determining factors of Web services adoption were identified from both in-depth interviews with Web services experts and a literature review. The questionnaire was pretested with a pilot survey of seventy-four South Korean firms. Logistic regression was the main statistical analysis method, and the test showed significant correlation between some factors and whether to adopt. Important factors are business benefit driver (BBD), readiness (RD), and trust (TRUST).

%X While Information Technology (IT) has been identified by researchers as a source of strategic advantage for businesses, commentators have argued that this reality may not endure. These commentators argue that the growing ubiquity of IT makes it a commodity input rather than a scarce and valuable resource. We examine CEOs’ Letters to Shareholders, one of the primary statements of corporate strategy, using both content analysis and latent semantic analysis, a text mining technique. Examining these letters allows us to investigate whether IT may be declining in strategic importance over time. We examine 160 annual reports from firms in the healthcare industry, covering a ten-year span of time, from 1997 through 2006. Our results indicate that the strategic emphasis placed on IT may be increasing, but its association with firm performance is declining. Our findings imply that as markets become more competitive, IT management capabilities and the strategic use of IT take on increasing importance. Our findings also imply that CEOs’ perception of the importance of IT is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for improved firm performance. This article makes two primary contributions. First, we present an empirical examination of the issue of IT commoditization as a complement to existing anecdotal discussions. Second, we demonstrate the use of latent semantic analysis (LSA), a relatively new methodology for analyzing textual data, one that is evolving into an alternative to the well-known content analysis technique.

%X This study focuses on Health Information Technology (Health IT) in improving the decision-making process concerning disability benefits. Using a multimethod, multilevel approach that includes case analysis and semi-structured interviews, this study examines the practices, challenges, and potential solutions or methods involved in adequate and timely collection of medical evidence through information technology (IT) to support disability determination. Researchers collected qualitative data through fifty-six semi-structured thirty-minute interviews with Disability Determination Services (DDS) personnel in three states. Based on site observations, interviews, and document analysis, they developed two provider case studies. To demonstrate the adequacy and timeliness of medical evidence collection, the study also examined and reviewed twelve disability claimant cases. Findings suggest that, at the payer and provider levels, electronic solutions provide more adequate and timely responses to medical evidence requests. Based on the case studies, implemented Health IT reduces incomplete medical evidence and decreases provider turnaround time in processing a payer’s requests. Among the claims examined, 50 percent received low scores for adequacy of medical evidence and 33 percent received high or medium scores for delay of return of medical evidence of record. This examination of disability determination demonstrated that Health IT holds promise for clinical data use in this context.

%X The design science research (DSR) paradigm prescribes building and evaluating an Information Technology (IT) artifact to address organizational problems incorporating and enhancing relevant theories. In this article, we present a large-scale design science project that aims to address problems in the digital-government domain. The COPLINK project started at the University of Arizona with National Institute of Justice (NIJ) funding to integrate data from multiple law-enforcement databases and subsequently broadened in scope and funding to develop methodologies for capturing, searching, analyzing, and visualizing information for law-enforcement, intelligence, and national security applications. The project involves a complete spectrum of DSR activities including problem diagnosis, technology invention, technology evaluation, and theory building, while contributing to appropriate knowledge bases and making a significant impact on the real-world IT problems. Algorithms, methodologies, techniques, and the resulting Information Systems designed as part of the project are being successfully used in over 300 law-enforcement agencies, and have generated more than forty peer-reviewed publications. In this article, we describe these artifacts and the design process behind them, present summaries of evaluative studies, and discuss the factors that we believe were behind the success of this decade-long DSR project.

We provide geographical comparisons of researcher affiliations for the AIS regions and for North American versus global institutions, along with a comparison of prior and current results. Our analysis shows that coauthorship is increasing in the top three IS journals and that most of the leading researchers continue to affiliate with institutions in North  America. However, the proportion of publications from North American researchers in the top three journals has decreased slightly over time This research contributes to the scientometric literature by identifying a more broad and inclusive set of leading IS publications and by providing benchmarks for the productivity of IS scholars. These results can be valuable for deans and department chairs making tenure and promotion decisions. Prospective students and faculty can use these results to identify universities which match their personal research goals. This study also helps to define and expand the boundaries of the IS discipline due to its use of a broader set of leading journals.

%X Various e-learning systems have been developed and implemented in educational contexts. However, few studies try to go beyond the experimental level of identifying numerous factors that influence this technology and apply them to a real academic class of students. This article based on an in-depth analysis of a business school case--Montpellier Business School (France)--and survey data from 405 students assessed on their use of the e-learning platform, helps illuminate the patterns involved in e-learning performance. A literature review on e-learning performance factors is realized and a theoretical model focusing on three dimensions of e-learning performance--the learner side, the institutional environment and the e-learning system per se--is presented and tested empirically. The key findings of this paper identify motivation and self-discipline of students as main drivers of e-learning outcomes. Other results show that the integration of e-learning in a pedagogical program requires the analysis of its performance not only from learners and instructors point of view, but also from the underlying strategic perspective of the institution.

%X We all need ways to assess the quality of the information we look for, but this task is critically important when we are seeking health information. Healthcare consumers increasingly seek and use health information to address their health concerns. However, many health consumers lack the time and expertise required to make solid judgments about the quality of health information they encounter. A full range of quality appraisal methods for health information offer help, yet health consumers use those methods infrequently. Health consumers need better support to overcome barriers to efficiency, scalability, and transparency often associated with this breadth of valuable methods. Furthermore, they need ways to assess the quality of health information they find in the context of their own, individually situated needs. Our goals were to investigate the concept of health information quality and to explore how we can provide health consumers with better support by highlighting, rather than hiding, important aspects of health information quality. First, by reviewing and synthesizing criteria used by a broad range of quality appraisal methods for health information, we identified four focal characteristics of health information quality: content, reference, authorship, and publisher. Together, these four characteristics of intrinsic quality provide an organizing framework for health consumers to assess the quality of health information along multiple dimensions according to their own needs. Next, we used a user-center approach to design a prototype tool that concretely illustrates our framework by allowing the user to highlight multiple dimensions of health information quality. We present a usage case example of this illustrative tool, which visualizes the quality of MEDLINE search results. Our work provides a new perspective on health information quality by acknowledging and supporting consumers' needs for transparency and flexibility as they take a prominent role in health information quality assessment.

%X Scholarly research continues to be a significant component of a faculty member's portfolio.  The evaluation of the quality and quantity of that research is becoming increasingly important for tenure and promotion decisions and post-tenure reviews.  Using surveys, several recent articles attempted to rank or group IT journals by quality perceptions.  This study extends these previous studies by considering the quantity dimension of scholarly research by investigating the number of publications that appear in a set of top-tier IT journals by both individual author and institution.  Data is presented on the most prolific publishers and the most productive IS departments in publishing in these "premier" journals.  1223 authors from 389 different universities were published with an average of 1.41 authors per IS article.  Only three non-U.S. universities (National University of Singapore, Queen's University, and University of British Columbia) are in the top 24 publishing universities. 73% of researchers who published in these "premier" journals publish less than one adjusted count article in a top-tier article in 5 years using the adjusted count.  Only 49 authors had their names on 5 or more top-tier IS articles in 5 years leading to the conclusion that achieving tenure is next to impossible if the "premier" journals are the only acceptable ones at a university.

%X Reading recent knowledge management (KM) articles, one cannot escape the impression of a recycled concept. Definitions of the new field look remarkably like those of information systems, decision support systems, and even data management of the past. Since we believe KM is essentially new, a refined articulation of KM is desirable. Our point of departure is the observation that yesterday's data are today's information, which will become tomorrow's knowledge, and knowledge, in turn, recycles down the value chain back into information and into data. We outline a framework of KM that articulates the basic terms of this perpetual process. The proposed model defines operations and transformations of data-to-information, information-to-knowledge, and their reverse order.  Such transformations correspond to a time dimension of past-present-future and resemble the process of abstraction. Based on our analysis, we conclude that knowledge management is truly a new idea, not a recycled concept.

%X As educational institutions seek to maintain high quality of their course offerings while maintaining steadily growing number of graduates in the new American economy, a natural trend is a readiness to embrace information technology as a method of curriculum delivery. Many U.S institutions find Distance Learning as a means of striking this balance between quality and demand. For them, evidence exists that Distance Learning might well be what is needed to assure that extraneous factors such as location, work schedule, current work load and family pressures would not prevent an otherwise able and willing student from completing a college degree program. With the growing digital divide between the nation's mainstream population and the African American population, an issue rightly becoming a focal point for today's policy makers, it becomes necessary to explore the extent to which the Historically Black Colleges and universities (HBCU's) have embraced Distance Learning (D/L), given that D/L is fast becoming a norm as a supplemental education delivery method in other American universities.   This study sets out to examine where the HBCU's are in comparison with other institutions, and attempt to explain why the institutions are placed in this position. The study further attempts to suggest what must be done for the HBCU's to catch up with peer institutions. In the end, we conclude that more than traditional institutions, and given the growing digital divide in the new economy, the answer  to closing the gap between the "IT-haves and have-nots" may well lie on the extent to which HBCU's could adopt Distance Learning as an education delivery tool.  A further study is suggested as a means of empirically explaining the observed  differences and equipping the nation's HBCU's with the tools they need to adopt Distance Learning effectively.     A short tutorial on distance learning is presented as an appendix.

This paper examines empirically the outcomes of the reviewing processes of three well-known IS conferences held in 2007. Our analyses reveal four major findings. First, the evaluation criteria that influence the acceptance/rejection decision vary by conference. Second, those differences can be explained in terms of the maturity and breadth of the specific conference of interest. Third, while objective review criteria influence acceptance/rejection decisions, subjective assessment on the part of the program committees may also play a substantial role. Fourth, while high scores on objective criteria are essential for acceptance, they do not guarantee acceptance. On the other hand, low scores on any criterion are likely to result in rejection.

%X Commentators on Information Systems (IS) education have urged the IS community to develop new and alternative IS curricula. The IS 2002 model curriculum has recently been revised. The new IS 2010 curriculum guidelines for undergraduate degree programs in Information Systems [Topi et al. 2010] has a curriculum structure to accommodate the education of several different professional roles within IS. This paper identifies one such role, the Business Information Systems Designer. It presents and argues for a new, integrated Bachelor of Science curriculum for Business Information Systems Design (BISD 2010) to educate for this role. The proposed curriculum focuses on the design and use of IS in business and has a strong design focus. The education focuses on developing and training a set of capabilities that enables the Business Information Systems Designer to participate in the design of business and IS in concert. Some examples of capabilities are communication and presentation skills, business and industry understanding, and high-level modeling. Consequently, the curriculum adopted a capabilities-driven pedagogical model in order to train specific skills. The paper presents the BISD 2010 with its specific expected learning outcomes, structure, and pedagogy, and also how the students should be able to fulfill the learning outcomes. The proposed curriculum differs from much of the current IS model curriculum discussions in a number of respects: (1) it is built on a notion of design, design science, and design as a profession, (2) it is based on a capability driven pedagogical model, (3) the curriculum is modeled for a European higher education context and the Bologna accord, and (4) it is not a model curriculum, but a specific, comprehensive, and ambitious curriculum for a degree program.

%X Higher education institutions are increasingly using social software tools to support teaching and learning. Despite the fact that social software is often used in a social context, these applications can significantly contribute to the educational experience of a student. However, as the social software domain comprises a considerable diversity of tools, the respective tools can be expected to differ in the way they can contribute to teaching and learning. In this review on the educational use of social software, we systematically analyze and compare the diverse social software tools and identify their contributions to teaching and learning. By integrating established learning theory and the extant literature on the individual social software applications we seek to contribute to a theoretical foundation for social software use and the choice of tools. Case vignettes from several UK higher education institutions are used to illustrate the different applications of social software tools in teaching and learning.

%X Knowledge Management (KM) has emerged as a possible solution to many of the challenges facing U.S. and international healthcare systems. These challenges include concerns regarding the safety and quality of patient care, critical inefficiency, disparate technologies and information standards, rapidly rising costs and clinical information overload.  In this paper, we focus on clinical knowledge management systems (CKMS) research. The objectives of the paper are to evaluate the current state of knowledge management systems diffusion in the clinical setting, assess the present status and focus of CKMS research efforts, and identify research gaps and opportunities for future work across the medical informatics and information systems disciplines. The study analyzes the literature along two dimensions: (1) the knowledge management processes of creation, capture, transfer, and application, and (2) the clinical processes of diagnosis, treatment, monitoring and prognosis. The study reveals that the vast majority of CKMS research has been conducted by the medical and health informatics communities. Information systems (IS) researchers have played a limited role in past CKMS research. Overall, the results indicate that there is considerable potential for IS researchers to contribute their expertise to the improvement of clinical process through technology-based KM approaches.

%X Focus groups to investigate new ideas are widely used in many research fields. The use of focus groups in design research poses interesting opportunities and challenges. Traditional focus group methods must be adapted to meet two specific goals of design research. For the refinement of an artifact design, exploratory focus groups (EFGs) study the artifact to propose improvements in the design. The cycle of build and evaluate using EFGs continues until the artifact is released for field test in the application environment. Then, the field test of the design artifact may employ confirmatory focus groups (CFGs) to establish the utility of the artifact in field use. Rigorous investigation of the artifact requires multiple CFGs to be run with opportunities for quantitative and qualitative data collection and analyses across the multiple CFGs. In this paper, we discuss the adaptation of focus groups to design research projects. We demonstrate the use of both EFGs and CFGs in a design research project in the health care field.

%X We present a learning outcomes framework for an Information Systems (IS) undergraduate program. This framework includes a supporting software application that goes beyond any other attempt reported to date to integrate learning outcomes into program-wide and course-wide curriculum development, ongoing curriculum redesign, and student learning support. The Learning Outcomes Management System (LOMS) described here is a first-of-a-kind information system created as part of implementing a program-wide learning outcomes framework in a university setting. Our learning outcomes framework is distinct in that 1) it is based on a three-level hierarchically structured definition of learning outcomes that consistently apply to both the entire IS program as well as to each individual IS course; 2) customization for specific courses is easily done without requiring the drafting of new learning outcomes; 3) the dean’s office and faculty use the learning outcomes framework to design, monitor, and revise both the entire IS curriculum as well as each individual course on an ongoing basis; 4) when students assess their own capabilities against our school’s learning outcomes, it is done on a more global basis (versus a course specific basis), based on what students have done in their IS coursework, in their business, social science, and liberal arts coursework, as well as in their internships and extra-curricular activities; and 5) we incorporate the framework into a school-wide information system, LOMS, which has an application and supporting interface customized for faculty’s needs, students’ needs, and employers’ needs.

%X This case narrates a standard dispute between competing industrial coalitions in China and the U.S., both having an active involvement of the national governments. Specifically, the Chinese government organized the R&D of wireless local area network (WLAN) standards and tried to use them to replace the incumbent technologies controlled by international giants in the information industry. However, due to the strong objection of the foreign stakeholders in the WLAN market, China’s initiative eventually failed.
%X While there is ample knowledge available regarding successful experiences with technology standardization in the developed world, this case is unique because it deals with the unsuccessful experience of China. This case provides rare insights into the challenges that developing countries will meet in adopting indigenous technologies. It is useful for a discussion of how a country should organize its standardization activities.

%X This paper describes the research and development of a radio frequency identification (RFID)-based personal shopping assistant (PSA) system for retail stores. RFID technology was employed as the key enabler to build a PSA system to optimize operational efficiency and deliver a superior customer shopping experience in retail stores. We show that an RFID-based PSA system can deliver significant results to improve the customer shopping experience and retail store operational efficiency, by increasing customer convenience, providing flexibility in service delivery, enhancing promotional campaign efficiency, and increasing product cross selling and upselling through a customer relationship management (CRM) system. In this study, an RFID value grid for retail stores is proposed that allows managers to use RFID technology in stores to add value to the shopping experience of their customers. Four propositions are presented as the research agenda for examining the ability of RFID technology to improve the operations management of retail stores.

%X Recently, RFID has emerged to be a promising technology to revolutionize the supply chain and logistics management. Currently there exists a sharp contrast between retailers in China and their counterparts in the United States with respect for RFID adoption. In the United States, big retailers like Wal-Mart are actively pursuing RFID by issuing mandates to their suppliers worldwide for RFID adoption. However, retailers in China never enjoy such a dominating role in pursuing RFID. To explore what is behind this phenomenon, in this paper, an analysis framework is proposed to develop decision support tools for RFID technology adoption analysis in retailers in China. The framework is realized in a service platform developed based on three principles to help reach mutual understanding between RFID vendors and customers in RFID technology adoption analysis. The framework is illustrated and validated through an example to demonstrate its feasibility to help to analyze the adoption of RFID technologies retailers in China. The technology analysis service platform integrates various tools enabling interactive and flexible analysis processes to understand how RFID technology can be adopted and used effectively in retailers in China and in logistics and supply chain management.

%X Wireless technology, including mobile phones, WiFi-enabled laptops, and Bluetooth-connected devices, has become entrenched in today’s society, and we can expect this technology and its mobile applications to continue to evolve in the future. But what direction will this evolution take? The purpose of this paper is to look into the future and forecast where wireless is heading, recognizing full well that making such forecasts is fraught with danger. This paper first places the rise of wireless in an historical context relative to other important information technologies of the past. It then reviews mobile issues first presented in 2002 and examines where these issues stand today. The paper next looks at other views about the future of wireless. With this background the paper makes six forecasts about the future of wireless networks, mobile phones, wireless communications standards, wireless security, ultimate commerce, and the wireless market. Drawing on these forecasts, the paper describes several research questions that could yield valuable results in the wireless arena. The paper concludes with one final forecast.

%X A variety of organic models for systems development have been recommended for more than three decades. These models rest on the assumption that the uncertainty is high and additional team capabilities have to be developed during the project life-cycle. In contrast to the single-pass and document-driven waterfall model, organic models impose less rigid structure on the process, and they are geared toward exploration. We know little, however, about how uncertainties are managed over the life-cycle of organic systems development projects.
%X In response to this challenge, we adapt task uncertainty theory to conduct a qualitative study of management practices in a project based on two-phase funding, staged delivery, and a combination of prototyping and specifications. We provide detailed narratives of how uncertainties emerged, interacted, and were addressed in the project. The subsequent analyses suggest that the adopted organic model facilitated management of uncertainty, but it also introduced surprising and demanding management challenges that were not accounted for in the model.
%X The study adds to our understanding of management practices in organic systems development. It shows how combinations of offensive and defensive responses can help managers address the uncertainties they face. In addition, managers are advised to differentiate between developing know-what and know-how capabilities and to dynamically adapt their uncertainty response mode to fit a project’s evolving context.

%X TJX Companies Inc. is a leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer with headquarters situated in the United States. In late 2006, the company discovered it was victim to a massive security breach which compromised millions of customer records. Despite the internal exchanges within the IT department concerning the upgrade of their wireless security standard protocol, the company opted for cost savings rather than increased spending. As the company financials took a hit, the company was faced with pending lawsuits from credit card companies and affected customers; government scrutiny of IT security standards; loss of consumer confidence; among other concerns. Though it has not yet concluded the extent of the financial impact of this incident, analysts estimate the full cost of the breach might amount up to one billion dollars. This case presents a “wake-up call” for retail companies about the importance of IT security.

%X Agile software development in a distributed setting is challenging. The teams involved in the process face difficulties in communication, personnel selection, work culture, and knowledge management. The shortcomings associated with working in different time zones and the inabilities to develop trusting relationships between developers are well known. Companies often take recourse to agile software development methods in a distributed environment in search of reduced cost, higher efficiency, increased flexibility, and good customization. However, it is not clear whether agile methods can be successfully followed and their benefits realized in a distributed setting. This paper revisits and synthesizes the lessons learnt from twelve case studies detailing successful implementation of distributed agile software projects. The cases are analyzed from the perspective of the agile manifesto to determine how closely they follow its values and principles and to what extent they realize the benefits of the agile methodology. The cases lead to the discovery of disparate and innovative solutions adopted by different companies for overcoming the challenges of distributed agile software development. Some solutions are commonplace and others are unique and their combination in the context of the challenges is enlightening. The list of solutions can suitably guide companies that plan to adopt the agile methodology in distributed software development environments in future.

%X Prior to implementing “Agile” software development methods, organizations rooted in traditional “Waterfall” software development employed heavy upfront project design and limited changes and feedback during and between project stages. Waterfall methods make heavy use of outcome controls primarily monitored by the information systems function (ISF). This paper explores the control mechanisms used by the ISF and business function (BF) during and after the introduction of a major Agile project at a large U.S. company steeped in the traditional Waterfall method. Outcome control, the predominant control mechanism used in the case company, gave way to a hybrid-like control that possessed mechanisms of emergent control while maintaining vestiges of some Waterfall-like outcome control. We observed that, prior to the introduction of Agile, the software-development process was firmly in the hands of the ISF. The introduction of Agile shifted some of the controller authority over the development process from the ISF to the BF. Lessons learned from the case study point to the complexity of designing control mechanisms during a transition from the Waterfall method to an Agile approach.

%X We describe an entrepreneurial approach for teaching a management information systems (MIS) course. The course builds on the psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness to encourage student motivation and engagement. Students are required to create new electronic businesses and to build prototypes of their electronic Web fronts. Students are also required to use the concepts taught in the course and to analyze the ventures’ strategies, related network externalities, and business processes and data analytics. The course has been taught since 2009 to five classes and more than two-hundred students. Using student evaluation questionnaires and four detailed interviews, we found that more than half of the students were enthusiastic about the new approach: they felt satisfied and even proud of their projects. However, a minority of students found the course over-complicated and even boring. We also found that students who expressed autonomy orientation engaged with the course, while students who expressed impersonal or controlled orientation did not. We believe that this analysis should help instructors in aligning new teaching opportunities created by IT to fit students’ orientations and needs.

%X With its increasing power and sophistication, IT plays a central role in accelerating the innovation process. As such, almost every industry today is spending billions of dollars in the race to unleash the potential of digital technologies. Yet, many companies are failing to harness their IT capabilities for innovation because of the poor relationship often existing between their IT division and other business units. To aid in overcoming this problem, we present the innovation and IT posture framework. The framework identifies the four different levels of posture IT divisions typically adopt in enterprises and the various stages of maturity in each posture. Our key message is that fertile ground for IT-driven innovation will only emerge when the IT posture aligns with what the rest of the enterprise expects. Based on our research and consulting work, we also offer five key lessons that will enable CIOs and innovation leaders to overcome these collaboration shortcomings and deliver real IT-driven innovations.

%X After officially appointing an AIS historian and forming the AIS history task force at the beginning of 2013, the AIS supported a set of systematic efforts, named IS history initiative, to preserve and represent the IS field’s history. From the perspective of the first AIS historian, I provide some background for the IS history initiative. Then I outline a detailed strategic plan and current status of its implementation. Ultimately, the IS history initiative has three goals: (1) to collect, represent, and preserve the IS field’s history; (2) to interpret, write, disseminate, and review the IS field’s history; and (3) to discover/identify IS genealogy, roots, sources, and facets that deserve to be examined from a historical point of view. Correspondingly, the strategic plan contains three parts. Each part has several specific tasks, many of which were already completed at the time of this writing, and several are either in progress or are planned for future efforts. This paper overviews both current efforts and guiding future efforts related to preserving and representing IS history.

%X As hospitals extend their service scope, they adopt more information systems. These systems are implemented in different timelines and the interfaces of databases become varied. Frequently, the exchange of information between various systems requires additional coordination or even manual input for unifying data. To embrace automation, the solution is to adopt enterprise application integration (EAI) technology, the middleware, to convert data from among various information systems to enable an efficient flow of data in the hospital. In this paper, we discuss and verify the impact factors on the integration levels of EAI by surveying larger hospitals above the regional level in Taiwan and testing a proposed research model. The findings of this study show that information technology infrastructure, hospital size, external pressure, internal pressure, and external support significantly affect the EAI level.

%X One of the great barriers to success for junior faculty is their romanticized image of the professoriate as an occupation marked by individual expertise and self-sufficient scholarship. As doctoral students, we tend to see the Ph.D. process as preparation for that self-sufficient existence rather than training for socialization into a community of scholars. According to Robert Boice [2000], "naiveté about the socialization process of the professoriate" leads to "failures and miseries." This paper builds on my experience as a doctoral student under Gary W. Dickson's mentorship at the University of Minnesota to explore the importance of scholarly communities and the need to train doctoral students to actively create, grow, and sustain such mutually-beneficial entities.

They also understand the goal of technology-based information systems (IS) delivers the right information to the right people at the right time so that both strategic and operational decisions can be made properly and quickly. This was the approach followed by the American subsidiary of a Japanese motor company. The firm implemented a single, unified, Web-based interface to centralize and synchronize data access to 12 stand-alone dealership sales applications. The implementation took less than six months and less than $500,000 was expended. Immediate results were that the sales managers became significantly more efficient with their time, the automobile division recognized a cost savings of $1.4 million through a more efficient use of employee resources, and there was an estimated $10 million savings corporate wide as a result of employee efficiency gains throughout the organization. Despite all of these benefits, the automobile division's chief information officer was faced with the decision of whether or not to return to fix the data integration and timeliness problems that remained among the division's autonomous sales applications. This case study series highlights the objectives, outcomes, and challenges that managers must address while implementing Web-based portals. This case series also provides a better understanding for identifying, leveraging, and improving operational efficiency within a firm.

The invited panelists are four faculty members specializing in information systems from the United States. The covered topics included cell phone TV and misconceptions surrounding it, wireless networks in disaster management, ubiquitous computing including "anatomy of a mote" and sensors, and the adoption of future wireless applications.  First, we present wireless cell phone TV as a functioning multipurpose computer, or a "Swiss army knife," of media devices. The misconceptions are stated, influenced by preconceived notions by the media critics as well as users. Next we discuss a range of wireless technologies including wearable computing, ad hoc and mesh wireless networks as a means of providing communications for first respondents during a natural or man-made disaster. Then we examine the anatomy of motes and RFIDs, including sensors, in an era of ubiquitous computing and a world of (inter-)connected objects. Finally, we discuss the socio-cultural constructs impacting users' intentions to adopt future wireless applications.

Several course-related and environment governed trends seem to impact the coverage, including the growing popularity of object-oriented techniques, the shortening of the life cycle and the emergence of the iterative approach, the increasing adoption of the agile approach, the rising importance of UML, the outsourcing trend leading to global distribution of SA&D work, and the rate of change in the technical and business environments. The scope of the SA&D course has increased. Yet, most MIS degree programs have just one SA&D course. The typical SA&D instructor faces a number of difficult questions when trying to fit the much larger range of topics into a single course. A panel at the Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS) 2007 conference evaluated how the trends impact the coverage of the SA&D course and made recommendations on how these trends can be addressed. Based on the panel discussion, this paper tackles the many challenges of teaching analysis and design in the IS curriculum and taking it to the next level.

%X Virtual communities that feature avatars are an emerging social software business model on the Internet. Avatars are Internet users' graphical representations of themselves in virtual environments. This study investigates how virtual community members' satisfaction with avatars is formed. We test a research model that proposes that social factors influence virtual community members' satisfaction with avatars. We draw upon social presence theory, social comparison theory, and self-identity theory. Data from a field experiment (N=134) is analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Our results provide empirical support for our proposed model. We report that social factors affect virtual community members' satisfaction with the use of avatars in virtual communities. Our intended contribution is to help both managers and academics understand aspects of customer behavior and customer satisfaction when using avatars in virtual communities. This study also presents suggestions for future research regarding the use of social software in business.

%X In recent years the Swedish Police Force (SPF) have encountered greater demands on availability and 24/7 services when dealing with errands that are regarded as low priority compared to regular police work, e.g. collecting tips from the public. One attempt to meet these increasing demands was the development of a mobile communications platform that allowed the public to communicate easily with the SPF using their own mobile phones by sending SMS and MMS. The focus of this paper is on the early phases of development of this m-service, in particular, on the specific technical issues such as interoperability and standards used by the actors on the scene affecting the development of mobile information systems. The learning experiences are as follows: First, mobile communication platforms have a large potential for contributing to the field of emergency management information systems since they can be based on open and nationally accepted standards. Second, global and national standards for sending multimedia messages are not always truly standardized. Operators and mobile phone manufacturers make minor alterations and interpretations of the standard and thereby some of the benefits found in standards disappear. Third, when developing mobile information systems we suggest and recommend that the analysis phase should be enhanced compared to traditional system development, and it should address the interoperability between mobile phones on one hand and operators on the other hand.

%X In this paper, we propose an integrative framework based on dynamic models of the evolution of industries.  The main arguments are illustrated using the case of mobile TV.  One main assertion is that the value network of mobile data services is much more complex than that of previous "generations" of mobile services, in particular voice and messaging.  The new environment requires a significantly higher degree of coordination and integration between more participants in the value net and a consistent constellation of technology, policy and firm strategy.  Unless such compatible arrangements are in place, mobile TV will not take off.  The paper develops these themes theoretically and illustrates them with a detailed case study of mobile TV in South Korea as well as comments on the situation in Europe and the U.S.  The private and public sectors in South Korea were capable of producing conditions in which mobile TV could flourish.  Even so, significant challenges remain to create a financially sustainable mobile TV industry.  In contrast, in Europe and the U.S. major obstacles to the development of mobile TV continue to exist.  Unless these obstacles, including problems with spectrum policy, are addressed, mobile TV may not be able to develop its full market potential.

%X This paper presents a model of the drivers of e-government maturity. We differentiate "maturity" from "readiness" on the basis that the former refers to demonstrated behavior, while the latter provides an idea of a country's potential to achieve e-government, and argue that maturity is a more accurate measure of a country's realized progress. We investigate the prevalence of affluent countries in many e-government rankings using a model where the relationship between GDP and e-government maturity is mediated by ICT infrastructure, human capital, and governance. Using data from authoritative sources, we find that most of the positive influence of GDP on e-government maturity occurs through ICT infrastructure. More mature e-government, however, does not necessarily reflect better governance; in fact our data show a weak but significant negative relationship between e-government maturity and the quality of governance. We suggest plausible explanations for these findings and how the future evolution of e-government might change the observed relationships.

%X It is almost unbelievable that in this age of technology we are experiencing decreasing worldwide enrollments in Information Systems (IS) programs. Suddenly, within a year or two, enrollments decreased as much as 70-80 percent throughout the world. Industry is begging for more graduates with a business and technical background and is expecting an even greater shortage in the next few years. Despite reports of the outsourcing of technical positions, there is a growing demand for IS graduates. This paper presents an overview of the discussion, resulting from a panel at the Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS) 2007, of declining enrollments and some suggestions to reverse the trend. Two major themes, marketing and curriculum, emerged.

%X Selecting an appropriate process modeling language forms an important task for organizations engaging in business process management initiatives. A plethora of process modeling languages has been developed over the last decades, leading to a need for rigorous theory to assist in the evaluation and comparison of the capabilities of these languages. While substantial academic progress in the area of process modeling language evaluation has been made in at least two areas, using an ontology-based theory of representation or the framework of workflow patterns, it remains unclear how these frameworks relate to each other. We use a generic framework for language evaluation to establish similarities and differences between these acknowledged reference frameworks and discuss how and to what extent they corroborate each other. Our line of investigation follows the case of the popular BPMN modeling language, whose evaluation from the perspectives of representation theory and workflow patterns is comparatively assessed in this paper. We also show which tenets of modeling quality these frameworks address and that further research is needed, especially in the area of evaluating the pragmatic quality of modeling.

%X In this dynamic age of corporate acquisitions, mergers, and enterprise integration, decisions concerning the evaluation and selection of information systems require comparing the functionality of each candidate system to the intended business activities that it will support. However, consensus on the definition of business activities used to support this evaluation is rare. What is needed is a referent business activity model that defines the business in a manner to serve as the basis for determining how well each candidate system supports the business. This paper 1) defines the referent business activity model concept; 2) provides an example from a case study of business activity modeling; and 3) demonstrates the utility of this model in defining functional requirements for selecting the optimal system from a set of 30 legacy systems to be used throughout the United States Department of Defense (DoD). Twenty-nine DoD business experts were able to construct a referent business activity model consisting of 65 business activities organized in a hierarchical manner. These activities served as the foundation for a questionnaire of 165 questions used to select three information systems out of the over 300 known systems that supported one or more of the 65 business activities. This experience demonstrated the feasibility of achieving consensus among business experts on one referent business model. It also demonstrated the utility of that model in evaluating legacy systems. This case provides a detailed example that business experts can bridge the gulf of ambiguous systems requirements that exists between real-world business activities and the information systems that support them.

%X Every year, the Dutch Minister of Health promises that by the following year, all citizens in the Netherlands will have an Electronic Health Record (EHR). Until now this promise has not been met. One of the main requirements for realizing a national EHR is an interoperability framework, agreeable to the government, vendors and users. This paper first studies the demand side using the results of twenty two interviews with physicians, asking them about their core processes and their expected value of an EHR. This provides us with the adoption perspective on the EHR market. Next we look at the current EHR market, investigating the suppliers and their achievements and market share. Finally we take a look at the government side with an overview of the interoperability requirements dictated by the national IT-agenda for healthcare. The contribution of this paper is twofold:  o	First, our main conclusion is that success in the EHR market in the Netherlands is not yet motivated by interoperability requirements. o	Second, from a detailed analysis on micro level the following result stands out: A majority of the end users (demand side) do not get support in their relevant working processes.

%X Service-Oriented Architecture(SOA) is primarily regarded as a technical architecture consisting of tools and service specification to build loosely coupled applications. At another level it is also a means to leverage flexibility and agility to system services as it offers a hierarchical framework to coordinate simultaneous business process design and implementations using loosely coupled service infrastructures. SOA has been debated both in the academy and industry and misinterpretations of its nature impede its adoption. We summarize its historical origins and current evolutions. We review technologies that underlie SOA. In particular, we address how to integrate SOA initiatives with current technology platforms, and how to enforce reuse during the design of loosely coupled systems. We also analyze SOA design methodologies and platforms, and what are their roles in the application integration. Finally we outline challenges and future research directions for SOA.

%X Web accessibility is the practice of making Web sites accessible to people, such as the disabled, to access the Internet. Approximately 40 million Americans have some form of disability, and slightly less than 2.5 million are enrolled in postsecondary institutions. Since the instructional role of the Internet has become a central part of both conventional classroom instruction and distance education, it is imperative that instructional Web sites be designed for accessibility. The purpose of this article is to introduce Web accessibility issues to university faculty. The tutorial contains two main sections. In the first, we review the literature on the magnitude of the problem, empirical studies, and the legal mandates surrounding Web accessibility. In the second section, we discuss the standards related to Web accessibility, and the authoring and evaluation tools available for designing accessible Web sites.

%X Although much IS research deals with evaluating and improving existing information systems, researchers are also called upon to think about the future, particularly beyond organizational boundaries. Examples include: the potential impact of socio-technical phenomena such as the digital divide, digital rights management, security, and privacy. One way of forecasting the future is to extrapolate empirically observed relations (e.g. Moore’s law). However, such extrapolations assume that the future is an immutable extension of the present and are usually limited to one or two dimensions. Externalities due to disruptive inventions, changes in regulations, tastes, competition, required skills, and more also need to be considered. This tutorial presents and explains three methodologies that take these possible changes into account to improve our understanding of the future: Delphi, cross impact analysis, and scenarios.

%X Service computing has become the new frontier of enterprise computing in the continued pursuit of organizational agility. Many major corporations are in the midst of implementing significant initiatives to re-architect their IT through service computing to help meet fast changing business requirements. As a result, many new and interesting research questions arise in this area, spanning technical, organizational, and economic issues. Currently, there is a great need for a framework for aligning the issues of technology and management in the era of service computing. This paper outlines the key points presented at the International Conference on Information Systems 2007 panel on Bridging Service Computing and Service Management. The first few sections of the paper contain viewpoints of each panelist on why and how MIS should take leadership in this research area. Then, a joint perspective on bridging service computing and service management is presented.

%X As the range of ICT applications in business organizations grows ever larger and takes up an increasing amount of time, the question arises as to whether this could have an impact on meetings. This paper explores the extent to which the use of ICTs replaces face-to-face interactions. The data was gathered by telephone interviews from a sample population of 2,500 company managers questioned over a five-year period between 2001 and 2005. The results indicate that substitution of face-to-face interactions by e-mail only occurs in a few organizations (< 15 percent of cases), while a quarter of the sample population felt that ICT use had led to an improvement in meetings. This appears to confirm the superposition effect of different media or the so-called “Napoleon effect.”

%X The popularity of e-commerce can be attributed to open (and mostly unbridled) competition with minimal barriers to entry. Yet, recent surveys suggest a general lack of consumer confidence in transacting online. Such findings are troubling — pointing to probable inefficiencies in e-commerce. The question then is: what are these inefficiencies and how do they prompt such consumer uncertainty? In answering the question, this paper surfaces three core e-commerce inefficiencies: seller anonymity, lack of product transparency, and lack of process transparency. It is also contended that consumer uncertainty is not an intrinsic buyer characteristic. Rather, it is contingent upon the information specificity of specific products that consumers transact in B2C and C2C e-commerce. Tying together threads from behavioral economics, this paper offers a novel perspective toward understanding electronic market inefficiencies and its consequent effects on consumer uncertainty. Apart from proposing a model of consumer uncertainty in e-commerce, the study offers a preliminary empirical validation of the proposed model. Findings suggest that inherent Ecommerce inefficiencies of anonymity and lack of product and process transparencies cause consumer uncertainty. The findings further evidence how buyer uncertainty increases when planning to buy products with high information specificity, especially when product transparency is lacking.

The field includes a small number of academics who research and engage in discourse on information systems topics from a critical theory perspective. The growth and influence of this group are the focus of this enquiry. The paper reports the results of an extensive demographic and content survey of information systems research and writing activity from a critical perspective published in leading information systems journals, conferences and specialist critical information systems forums in the period 2001–2005. Patterns and trends of critical research and of critical IS researchers and authors are identified. The findings show distinct regional and gender distributions of authors of critical papers compared with IS field norms. The paper contributes to the IS field’s development by raising awareness of critical researchers’ activities and providing an analysis of critical activity in the IS field.

%X Recently, the role of outsourcing vendors in outsourcing projects has been attracting increasing attention. This would imply that the studies on outsourcing truly require an understanding of both parties, i.e., the vendor and the customer, to realize the expected benefits. Although such benefits are mainly determined by how the outsourcing process is defined and managed, limited research has been done on the outsourcing process from the vendor’s perspective. The objective of this study is to provide guidance to organizations that plan to outsource or have already outsourced their IT functions in order for them to reap greater outsourcing benefits by understanding the vendor’s outsourcing process model. It also aims to assist vendors by exploring what key steps and concerns throughout the outsourcing process exist. To do so, this study develops a vendor’s outsourcing process model containing the type of vendor and structure of the vendor organization which comes strictly from the viewpoint of vendors. This is based on the author’s working experience and in-depth interviews with outsourcing practitioners in 15 IT companies. Such a model can provide valuable insights into the interconnection of vendor’s and customer’s outsourcing processes. Moreover, it can help customers and vendors expand their understanding of the outsourcing process from beginning to end.

%X We report results of a longitudinal case study in which an emergency medical service replaced a paper-based medical record with an electronic medical record system. The new systems electronically transmitted patient information to various other agencies for reporting, medical quality control, and billing purposes. As expected, the time required for the paramedics to document the medical record increased immediately after system implementation. As a result, operational performance of the paramedics declined. An unexpected consequence of system implementation was that operational performance never reached the level achieved prior to system implementation. However, the benefits attained by all organizations involved outweighed the prolonged decrease in operational performance of the paramedics. Therefore, we advise organizations implementing technology crossing organizational boundaries to consider both the direct and indirect benefits of a system implementation and to evaluate both operational and organizational performance.

%X Analytics is the most advanced component of business intelligence. An analytic capability enables fact-based decisions using quantitative models. These models draw on statistical and quantitative analysis of large data repositories. An analytic capability is especially critical in healthcare because lives are at stake and there is intense pressure to reduce costs and improve efficiency. This study proposes antecedents and catalysts for developing an analytic capability based on an in-depth study of the cardiac surgical programs of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The VHA has developed an analytic capability for patient treatment and administrative decision-making. The models rely on the input of clinical data from multiple facilities. However, a diversity of standards, infrastructure, staff and patient mix result in misunderstood data definitions, errors in data entry, incomplete data sets, and conflicts between multiple systems. Consequently, data aggregation and data interoperability at both the systemic and semantic levels are challenging. Catalysts for developing an analytic capability, derived from the VHA case study, include a community of practice and patient case reassessment practices. Antecedents of an analytic capability include robust data aggregation and cleaning practices and establishment of data standards followed by judicious tailoring of analytic outputs to decision making needs.

Second Life provides the economic and technological platform required for immersion, social interaction, and the potential of private enterprise. Many entrepreneurs have taken advantage of the various business opportunities offered in Second Life, and a number have earned significant income through their in-world creations and services. Stuart O'Brian, the CEO and founder of VirtualCircle, was one of the early pioneers of virtual commerce. Over the last three years, his organization faced multiple business and technology challenges while negotiating the hypercompetitive and turbulent environment within Second Life. However, he now questions the sustainability of the ever-changing and agile business model that enabled the success of VirtualCircle. Stuart also faces questions regarding avenues of future growth and is grappling with issues concerning interoperability and the replication of his prior success in other virtual environments—and the real world.

%X Although online social network services (OSNS), e.g., Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, LinkedIn, are enjoying rampant popularity, a subsection of the population (i.e., nonadopters) continues to forgo using them. Our study is one of the first to focus exclusively on what might motivate nonadopters to accept a widely adopted IT. By considering nonadopters’ inertia within the context of early stages of innovation diffusion and incorporating status quo bias theory into well-established technology acceptance model (TAM) relationships, this study uncovers the finding that people who report that they do not use OSNS would use them if they thought OSNS were easier and more enjoyable to use, and if they were persuaded by others to use them. Our findings suggest these nonadopters do not see the usefulness of OSNS, risks of sharing personal information publically, or the perceived amount of effort in using OSNS as factors that influence potential acceptance and use of the technology. This study contributes to research by offering an integrated theoretical framework that updates TAM with status quo bias theory to study nonadopters and offers IS practice guidelines for OSNS providers to attract nonadopters to accept and use the technology.

%X This article collects and analyzes seventy-six maturity model articles that have been published in leading Information Systems (IS) journals and conference proceedings during the past fifteen years. We study the IS literature on maturity models from three different perspectives: a research perspective, which is particularly relevant for scholars who are interested in the design and adoption of maturity models; a publication perspective, which reflects the interests of authors and reviewers of maturity model articles; and a practitioner’s perspective, which is especially relevant for maturity model users and consultants. The results are interesting in several respects. From the research perspective, the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) is the most dominant foundation of past IS research on maturity models. In contrast, theories on the design and adoption of maturity models are distinctly rare in our sample. The publication outlets that are considered feature quantitative and qualitative empirical research alike, but―with a decreasing number―purely conceptual research as well. Of late, past maturity model research can mainly be located in the area of IT and organizations, while the formerly very popular domain of IS development is of less interest today. As for the publication perspective, we find that the level of publication activity in the field has generally been increasing over the last fifteen years, with North American and European researchers dominating the academic discussion. Finally, with regard to the practitioner’s perspective, we compile advice on the practical application of maturity models from a critical analysis of the literature. It is hoped that the results can stimulate and guide future research in the field and inform the development and usage of theoretically sound maturity models in practice.

%X Khillwar is a mobile game developer from India faced growing competition. Its leadership position in India prompted it to scout out opportunities for growth outside the country. As a strategic move, the management team of Khillwar planned to expand into emerging markets and selected China as the new business battlefield. China seemed to be the promising land of opportunities for mobile game developers and operators. However, the Chinese market posed a number of significant challenges for foreign companies, making it risky to step into this market. This case discusses the opportunities and the key challenges associated with the decision to expand in China for an Indian mobile gaming software company such as Khillwar. The teaching case is focused on discussion of various issues that an IT company needs to consider when contemplating growth outside its country of origin. The students need to consider the pros and cons of expanding into the China market and make recommendations to the management of the Khillwar team on how to make the expansion smooth and successful. This case explains the challenges of expansion to a new IT market and, specifically, to a new emerging IT market for a successful IT company.

%X Technological discontinuities can fundamentally alter the competitive dynamics of sectors of the economy: IT can create opportunities for those who are able to transform themselves, while simultaneously putting others out of business. Leadership is a key determinant of the outcome of an IT-enabled transformation, but there is limited research on the role of leaders in responding to such disruptions. This article explores the role of the leader in a period of technological change through an extension of the theory of transformational leadership. We illustrate the extended theory through a commercial printer, EarthColor. The commercial printing industry is in a strategic transition, characterized by consolidation and increasing cost pressures that drive profit margins down. We discuss how IT is responsible for the changing rules of competition in this industry, as well as the transformation of printing from a craft-based profession to a digitized business, from a traditional manufacturing “production” industry to a digital information management business. The article documents the experiences of EarthColor and the leadership of its CEO who successfully navigated an industry upheaval precipitated by IT. We generalize the results of our research to our extension of transformational leadership theory that explicitly incorporates the demands of IT-enabled transformations.

%X This paper investigates two actors in IT recruitment: IT job seekers and IT employers. Signaling theory and image theory inform this research. Signaling theory suggests that there are unique groups of IT job seekers and IT employers. Image theory explains the implications of groups of IT job seekers’ have images of firms. Based on a closet qualitative study, we identify three images that IT job seekers use to classify employers: IT consulting firms, IT vendors, and non-IT-oriented firms that require in-house IT workers. To evaluate these images, we conduct two studies. Study 1 evaluates job seekers. Analysis of data collected from 491 entry-level IT job seekers suggests that unique groups of IT job seekers exist that possess distinct preferences for IT employers, firm and job characteristics as well as report different levels of preparatory job search activity. Study 2 focuses on the IT employers’ perspective. We segment IT employers based on the IT job seekers' images. Results from a survey of 412 firm recruiters indicate that IT employers do not prefer different types of IT job applicants or engage in significantly different recruitment activities. Taken together, our studies provide a rich understanding of how IT job seekers view employers and how employers view job seekers.

%X The declining proportion of women in the IT profession contributes to the shortage of IT professionals and potentially has a detrimental effect on the success of design projects. However, we do not fully understand why that decrease is happening. Some studies have utilized a construct called stereotype threat to explain why women are rejecting IT as a profession. Others have claimed that the results of stereotype threat apply only in computer science programs housed in engineering schools. This study tests whether stereotype threat exists in an MIS program in a college of business and, if so, how it affects women’s confidence in their ability and motivation to continue their IT education. The results show no support for the stereotype threat hypothesis. Further analysis, however, shows that positive, supportive messages have more effect on these women than do the negative messages. Thus, while stereotype threat has been a successful model for explaining the behavior of women in the sciences, mathematics, and computer science, it does not appear to explain the decreases in the number of women in MIS programs in business schools. A discussion of the aspects of MIS programs that may attract women and possible ways to increase women are provided.

%X Ubiquitous healthcare information system is increasingly seen as a viable option for reducing the inherent time lag and inaccuracies in the traditional model of healthcare and promoting the delivery and practice of evidence-based healthcare―as and when needed―without any location and time constraints. Although promising, the realization of ubiquitous healthcare information system brings several threats and risks rooted in real-time collection, analysis, storage, transmission, and access of critical medical data. In this research, we address information security concerns pertaining to the paradigm of ubiquitous healthcare information system. To accomplish this we use National Institute for Standards and Technology’s (NIST’s) system development lifecycle model (SDLC) as the underlying framework to explore the current state of ubiquitous healthcare from the perspective of security. We then leverage the model to propose future research directions in this area. By implementing the NIST’s SDLC model in such a manner, we offer a different dynamic of healthcare security that has not been addressed in literature before.

%X The impact of enterprise systems (ES) on organizational agility (OA) is an under-researched area. Given that most organizations are heavily investing on ES infrastructure and the increasing demand for agility, the lack of research on ES and OA is a critical oversight. This article reviews previous literature on information systems in general and ES in particular and organizational agility. The article offers a comprehensive and deepened perspective toward the existing discourses on ES-enabled organizational agility. Using insights from the dynamic capability theory, we propose a conceptual framework that highlights how organizations can exploit ESs to improve their agility in two significant ways―by creating and constantly developing an ES-enabled sensing and responding capability. We also argue that the quality of the ES competence provides the necessary technical and business platform for deploying and exploiting ES in building and rebuilding sensing and responding capabilities. The proposed framework sheds light on three important missing factors in the realm of IT-enabled organizational agility, namely ES competency, the alignment between ES-enabled sensing and responding capability, and environmental dynamism. Our theorizing makes an original contribution to ES and IS research by extending previous works of IT-enabled organizational agility by introducing the three constructs previously mentioned.

%X The literature on IS alignment is extensive, has developed significantly in the last twenty-five years, and is itself based on fifteen years of prior work exploring the strategic possibilities of information systems. Several important models have now been developed, but it is not always clear how they relate to each other. This can be problematic for practitioners, as it is not clear how, and indeed when, alignment can benefit an organization. It can be problematic for academics, in that gaps and areas for further research cannot be systematically identified. Furthermore, most alignment studies are motivated by two considerations that have themselves changed over time. First, IS alignment can bring strategic benefits to an organization, and second, alignment is consistently ranked highly as a key issue for IS managers. Over twenty-five years, there have been several key developments in strategic theory, and the issues being addressed by IS managers have changed significantly. This article addresses both problems by providing a meta-model of alignment studies, based on their relationship to different strategic theories. It populates the meta-model with examples of previous studies and demonstrates how it can be used by practitioners and academics.

%X A continual debate surrounds the effectiveness of agile software development practices. Some organizations adopt agile practices to become more competitive, improve processes, and reduce costs. Other organizations are skeptical about whether agile development is beneficial. Large organizations face an additional challenge in integrating agile practices with existing standards and business processes. To examine the effects of agile development practices in large organizations, we review and integrate scientific literature and theory on agile software development. We further organize our theory and observations into a framework with guidelines for large organizations considering agile methodologies. Based on this framework, we present recommendations that suggest ways large organizations with established processes can successfully implement agile practices. Our analysis of the literature and theory provides new insight for researchers of agile software development and assists practitioners in determining how to adopt agile development in their organizations.

%X Many companies see Data Governance as a promising approach to ensuring data quality and maintaining its value as a company asset. While the practitioners’ community has been vigorously discussing the topic for quite some time, Data Governance as a field of scientific study is still in its infancy. This article reports on the findings of a case study on the organization of Data Governance in two large telecommunications companies, namely BT and Deutsche Telekom. The article proposes that large, service-providing companies in general have a number of options when designing Data Governance and that the individual organizational design is context-contingent. Despite their many similarities, BT and Deutsche Telekom differ with regard to their Data Governance organization. BT has followed a more project-driven, bottom-up philosophy; Deutsche Telekom, on the other hand, favors a rather constitutive, top-down approach. The article also proposes a research agenda for further studies in the field of Data Governance organization.

%X The relationship between Information Systems (IS) scholars and IS practitioners has been debated since the birth of the IS discipline. How are academics interacting with practice, and how should we? In this article we propose that academia-practice collaboration, namely “mutual informing,” is an existential aspect of the Information Systems field. This article is based on presentations, discussions, group work, and a debate that took place during the Fifth Kristiansand International Workshop on Information Systems Research (KIWISR), held at University of Agder in Kristiansand,  Norway. The theme of KIWISR-5 was “For Whom Do We Toil? Mutual Informing Between Academia and Practice.” As a synthesis of the workshop, we propose that mutual informing consists of, at least, topics such as choice of publication outlets, facilitation of collaboration, roles in research process, and delivery of teaching. Further, we suggest that mutual informing is concerned with transferring and transforming knowledge between the realms of design and development, use, and management of Information Systems. The biggest challenges to mutual informing are the different knowledge interests and timeframes between the realms of academia and practice.

%X This study posits an IS specific career choice model that provides good predictive power and elucidates the nuances of factors underlying attraction to an IS career. IS is a relatively new career option, which many students may be unaware of or may misconstrue; this suggests the need for discipline-specific understanding. In this study, we used the Theory of Reasoned Action, which is a well-developed and widely applied theoretical model, but it has only recently begun to be applied to understanding occupational intentions. We argue that the TRA is an especially useful model for developing an IS-specific model of career attraction because, unlike other theories of career choice, it specifies the effect of social environment and allows for a more nuanced understanding of the factors underlying attraction to IS. Undergraduate students in an introductory IS course at a large public university were surveyed to test the study’s model, providing empirical validation of a career choice model comprising IS-career relevant beliefs and values. Overall, findings reveal that intentions significantly influence actual behavior—completion of an IS degree. IS career attitudes and social beliefs, in turn, collectively form intentions about pursuing IS careers. More specifically, attitudinal beliefs such as software/programming skill self-efficacy and technical, income, leadership, and job-variety-related work values have significant influence on favorable attitudes. The normative beliefs derived from one’s referent others, i.e., family members, friends, teachers, and significant others, significantly impact IS attitudes and intentions. The research contribution and practical implications of this work are discussed.

Gray markets for IT products represent a grave threat for many IT companies. Monetary losses in profits due to IT gray markets are estimated to be in the billions of dollars. Despite the importance of guidance in addressing the IT gray market threat, the paucity of IS research in gray markets is surprising. In this article, we discuss the IT gray market phenomenon, present the legal status of gray markets in several developed and developing nations, suggest some strategies to address the gray market problem, discuss implications, and call for future IS research in this important area.

%X Global outsourcing of IT and IT-enabled services (ITES) has now become an accepted corporate strategy of a vast majority of firms around the world. The functions being offshored have increased in scope and magnitude and have climbed the value chain ladder. However, the literature has overwhelmingly focused on client-centric issues to the neglect of vendor concerns. There is a rich tradition of ranking critical issues confronting Information Systems executives, and some studies have even explored critical issues of outsourcing clients. These rankings have significant implications for both researchers and practitioners. Our study focuses on the nascent area of IT outsourcing vendors. We examine the issues from the standpoint of IT outsourcing vendors in India, currently the primary destination for IT offshoring. The results suggest that for the Indian vendors, the most critical issues are not related to cultural, language, and time-zone differences as suggested in many writings. Rather, the most critical concerns are issues dealing with work arrangements and relationships with the client, and issues related to the client’s organizational readiness for offshoring. Clearly the understanding of such issues is important to the vendors, but also to the clients in order to maintain an effective dyadic relationship.

Nevertheless, a few authors have examined the adoption of FLOSS and its impact on organizational change and innovation. Adoption studies represent a particularly promising area for information system researchers to investigate the relationship between the specific properties of FLOSS and the processes of implementation and use. The goal of this article is to contribute to this field of research by discussing a former multi-targeted research agenda and by defining an empirically grounded framework for studying FLOSS adoption, drawing on the outcomes of an exploratory multiple case study involving sixteen Italian public administrations.

This panel report describes the key findings and best practices that were identified. The article also serves as a “call to action” for universities regarding the need to close a widening gap between the BI skills of university graduates in Information Systems and other fields and BI market needs. The IS field is well positioned to be the leader in creating the next generation BI workforce. To do so, it is important for IS to begin moving on this opportunity now. We believe the necessary first step is for BI and IS leaders to advance the BI curriculum.

%X User experience (UX) research focuses in large part on how users subjectively evaluate digital products, services, and software. In the mobile computing domain, however, UX researchers currently face limitations in the multifaceted measures that they can apply to assess specific mobile device and software combinations. Currently available measures can produce only single-score usability measures (e.g., the well-known system usability scale and its variants) or cover only a part of the mobile device-software user experience (e.g., the recently developed mobile application usability instrument). This paper adds two multifaceted survey instruments to the toolkit of UX researchers and practitioners: the mobile user experience (MUX) instrument, a 15-item instrument tailored toward scholarly research, and the short-form sMUX, a six-item instrument intended for use in practical settings or other situations where survey length is constrained.

%X For a research field to advance, scholars must be able to openly exchange ideas. For this open exchange to exist, the contexts and methods that evaluate scholarly output must encourage this interchange. We argue that the current process for evaluating scholarly output, “counting articles in ranked venues” (CARV), creates pressures that result in a distorted discourse inhibiting the growth of the field. We review the current system of evaluating scholarly output and describe its virtues and shortcomings. Then, based on works by Habermas (1984) and Mingers and Walsham (2010), we suggest that the IS field should adopt an improved method of evaluation that enhances the openness of ideas. This method should be objective, reproducible, relatively easy to compute, and standardized. The new method should also produce easy-to-compute profiles of measures that assess a construct for scholarly output founded on a well-defined theory. It should also reduce the dependence on publishing in any particular journal. The scholarly capital model (SCM) represents one such method. We believe that wide adoption of the SCM would open the discourse and help the field to develop more rapidly.

%X We agree with Cuellar et al.’s (2019) main premise that, for a research field to advance, scholars must be able to openly exchange ideas. For such an open exchange to exist, the contexts and methods that evaluate scholarly output must encourage this interchange. Cuellar at al. argue that the current process for evaluating scholarly output (which they call “counting articles in ranked venues” (CARV)) creates pressures that result in a distorted discourse that inhibits the field’s growth. In this article, we extend the conversation by adding clarifications, further insights, raising questions, and providing different solutions. Specifically, for the sake of logical clarity of the ensuing debate, we separate individual research contribution (IRC) and field research discourse (FRD). We explain and clarify the pairwise relationships between CARV and IRC and between CARV and FRD in order to discuss the role of CARV or lack thereof in assessing research contribution and discourse. We posit that CARV may assess IRC but not FRD and offer insights into how to improve IRC and FRD. We provide anecdotal evidence that a CARV-free world could exist but that it would entail high agency cost. We also offer an alternative solution that could supplement or substitute CARV. We conclude that any attempt to measure IRC without adequately incorporating attributes of FRD habitat is destined to be flawed.

%X In their article, Cuellar, Truex, and Takeda (2019) criticize the “process for evaluating scholarly output, “counting articles in ranked venues’ (CARV)” (p. 188). In their view, CARV limits the open exchange of ideas and, thereby, democratic discourse, which leads to unwanted performative effects and, ultimately, inhibits the growth of the information systems (IS) field. They propose the scholarly capital model (SCM) as a preferable mechanism that evaluators should employ to assess scholarly capital instead of scholarly output. In this rejoinder, we argue that CARV does not claim to measure output quality; it neither limits quality in the IS field nor the IS field’s growth, and mingling the effects of CARV with debates on quality or growth could be misleading. Replacing CARV would not change the game, only its rules. We posit that we all entered academia voluntarily knowing its rules and argue that colleagues facing P&T committees should recognize and focus on the specific (CARV-based or not) criteria of their institutions’ committees. While we expect that a new method will replace CARV in the not so distant future, we are convinced that, until then, a CARV-based environment offers ample opportunity to advance quality and growth of the IS field.

%X The currently predominant method of counting articles in ranked venues (CARV) to assess one’s academic achievements has had a deleterious impact on the state of the IS field, which points to a need for a paradigm shift. In this rejoinder to Cuellar, Truex, and Takeda’s (2019) article, I extend the scholarly capital model that they propose and comment on its applicability, adoption, and potential misuse. I propose that the model would benefit if it included a new component – practical capital, which comprises three dimensions: knowledge outreach (a scholar’s direct contribution to professional forums), knowledge impact (a scholar’s indirect contribution to professional forums), and community engagement (a scholar’s connections with the non-academic sector). I strongly recommend that the Association for Information Systems accept a formal stewardship role and facilitate further development, testing, and promotion of the scholarly capital model.

%X Cuellar, Truex, and Tajeda (2019) take the position that counting the number of articles published in ranked venues is an inappropriate method of evaluating the scholarly performance of faculty. They base their contention on a number of unfounded assertions and unsupported arguments, which the author details and analyzes. They propose an alternative evaluation criterion, which they call the “scholarly capital model”. In this rejoinder, I critique this model and find it wanting.

%X We thank Karlheinz Kautz for organizing this debate and the four respondent groups for their thoughtful and challenging comments. In this rejoinder, we take the opportunity to amplify and clarify some points that were perhaps unclear or misunderstood in our initial article and to respond to areas where we disagree. We also acknowledge proposed extensions of the scholarly capital model (SCM) to include the assessment of the impact on practitioners and on others outside of academia. Our main point throughout the dozen years we have pursued this project is that for the field to progress we must have an open democratic discourse in which all ideas and all comers have access to the discourse. That does not mean that “anything goes”. Rather, we advocate a disciplined metatheoretical pluralism in which we evaluate work for admission to the discourse not by conformance to “normal science” but rather by its conformance to its stated metatheoretical commitments. The marketplace of ideas then determines which of the proffered ideas has the most use. Scholars can then be evaluated based on a profile of measures assessing their impact to the field such as those produced by the SCM.

%X Enterprise systems typically include constructs such as ledgers and journals with debit and credit entries as central pillars of the systems’ architecture due in part to accountants and auditors who demand those constructs. At best, structuring systems with such constructs as base objects results in the storing the same data at multiple levels of aggregation, which creates inefficiencies in the database. At worst, basing systems on such constructs destroys details that are unnecessary for accounting but that may facilitate decision making by other enterprise functional areas. McCarthy (1982) proposed the resources-events-agents (REA) framework as an alternative structure for a shared data environment more than thirty years ago, and scholars have further developed it such that it is now a robust design theory. Despite this legacy, the broad IS community has not widely researched REA. In this paper, we discuss REA’s genesis and primary constructs, provide a history of REA research, discuss REA’s impact on practice, and speculate as to what the future may hold for REA-based enterprise systems. We invite IS researchers to consider integrating REA constructs with other theories and various emerging technologies to help advance the future of information systems and business research.

%X This article presents a comprehensive method to assess system security risks. The method includes a cohesive set of steps to not only identify a more complete set of security risks but also assess them in a systematic manner. The method is based on the integration of two kinds of models: (1) qualitative models emphasizing security risk factors and security requirement determination and (2) quantitative models that focus on formal evaluation and assessment of system security risks. Unlike most of the existing methods, the proposed method covers the whole process of system security risk assessment spanning all three phases—ascertainment of security requirements, measurement of evidence for security requirements, and evaluation of evidence against the needed security mechanisms. The article extends existing work on system security risk methods by incorporating new ideas of multifaceted security view and work system in a coherent set of steps. The article demonstrates the application of the proposed method to a real application and discusses the major results.

%X We initiated the CAIS Special Section on Patient-Centered e-Health (PCEH) to provide support for the PCEH discipline, which has recently emerged to meet the practical need of supporting patients in managing their health. Because there are significant challenges in designing, developing, and using PCEH applications, there are many opportunities for IS researchers to study familiar topics, but in the very different healthcare delivery context. As an emerging discipline, PCEH is struggling with reconciling ambiguous definitions across studies, defining the discipline boundaries (how they overlap and are distinct from related research areas), and developing the exemplary research studies that can guide future research. Thus, the goal of this Special Section, as far as possible, is to gather a set of research articles that will move the PCEH discipline forward by providing resources and examples to support future PCEH research that is theory-based, is focused, and can build a cumulative literature and research tradition.
%X In this Introduction to the CAIS Special Section, we argue that IS researchers are especially well-equipped to undertake PCEH research and thereby overcome the many challenges unique to PCEH study. We discuss the challenges in the emerging PCEH discipline and present approaches that IS researchers might take to meet these challenges and produce the exemplary studies needed to further the discipline. Our arguments and observations are supported by the fourteen articles that make up the Special Section. These fourteen articles represent four areas of emerging PCEH research, namely PCEH and the Healthcare Delivery Context; Models of Acceptance, Use, and/or Outcomes; Patient-centered Design Research; and Assessment of PCEH websites.

%X The primary focus of this teaching case is the patient journey, as facilitated and influenced by an e-system or electronic health record (EHR) system. The goal of this case is to provide the learner with the knowledge and skills needed to effectively incorporate patient-centered e-health (PCEH) principles into existing and planned e-health systems such as EHRs. This case can be used to help students understand a hospital experience from the perspective of a patient and her family. It is loosely based on an experience one of the authors had with an actual patient. This case is intended for use with upper level undergraduate and graduate health informatics, information systems, and nursing students. Students assigned to this case should have a working knowledge of clinical terms and the general workings of a hospital. This teaching case is best suited to an advanced course in a health informatics curriculum. Possible applications of the case include, but are not limited to, describing the patient journey, modeling the process flow, diagramming the data flow, and applying the principles of patient-centered e-health.

%X This article presents progress with a conceptual framework for providing interactive healthcare guidance to help Aboriginal and ethnic minority patients disadvantaged by inter-cultural biopsychosocial barriers present in medical consultations. Using computer ontology development and semantic Web principles, an assistive communications technology (ACT) concept is proposed for primary care consultation process that we have titled the Patient-Practitioner Interview Encounter (PPIE) in primary care. Activity is devoted to the development of Patient Practitioner Assistive Communications (PPAC) ontology for type 2 diabetes, and we present a simple case study projection to show its application. In the PPAC ontology, concepts of type 2 diabetes will be mapped with Aboriginal English Home Talk through ontology relations and constraints. Aboriginal English PPIE pragmatics comprises a voluminous and multilevel combination of structured and unstructured data, and this is also mapped to the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) T2DM Guidelines for management of type 2 diabetes. In addition to patients and primary-care practitioners, eventual end-users may include allied health professionals, family, and other carers, qualified and ad hoc interpreters. The ultimate goal from the contribution of all participants is improved wellbeing outcomes for patients. A range of technologies augmenting communication with patients, mostly in conceptual or prototype trial form have been viewed as potential for alignment with our concept.

%X The IS 2010: Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Information Systems were published as a model to help academic IS programs establish a consistent curriculum that meets the needs of a global information economy. However, to-date, no study has examined the degree to which the IS 2010 model curriculum is being adopted and utilized in contemporary IS curricula. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the level of program adoption of the IS 2010 curriculum guidelines. Curriculum data were collected from 127 AACSB-accredited undergraduate information systems programs across the United States via a direct survey and interviews with department heads and undergraduate program directors. These data were then compared with the IS 2010 recommendations. Results indicate that: (1) IS programs exhibit a wide range of adherence to the IS 2010 core curriculum guidelines; (2) perceived adherence to IS 2010 guidelines among program administrators is higher than calculated adherence; (3) several non-IS 2010 core topics are still included as required components in many IS programs; (4) although few IS programs have formally implemented IS 2010 career tracks, perceptions of career tracks are generally favorable; (5) resource constraints and program enrollments/class sizes are commonly described barriers to developing career tracks.

%X Interpersonal persuasion is definitionally distinguished from broadcast persuasion by the presence of anticipated personal feedback and message coherence. Distinguishing interpersonal from broadcast messages in computer-mediated communication (CMC) may be an important individual tactic for avoiding information overload and filtering spam; however, we found no existing measures suitable for assessing these factors in CMC. This deficiency motivated the present study to develop and validate feedback and coherence questionnaire measures and conduct an initial test of the relevance of these measures to CMC. The measures met recommended criteria for content validity, construct validity, reliability, and predictive validity. In addition, the measures predicted most of the variance in social presence subjects perceived in our test messages and entirely mediated effects of whether the purported message sender was known or unknown to our subjects. These findings suggest feedback and coherence are important antecedents to persuasion in email, texting, instant messaging, and similar forms of CMC.

%X In today’s hypercompetitive environment in which markets change rapidly and competitive advantages are difficult to sustain, companies are forced to innovate and identify new business opportunities. However, innovation requires ingenuity and creativity. Product and service development depends on the creativity of employees, but harvesting and bringing novel ideas to fruition is often a chaotic process, which underscores the importance of creativity management within organizations. In this article, we review the literature on creativity in an effort to summarize state-of-the-art knowledge on how to stimulate creativity and spur innovation in modern organizations. For that purpose, we use Rhodes’ 4-Ps model (1961) distinguishing between creative environments (called press), people, products, and processes. Through a review of 110 journals on the AIS journal list, this article offers insights―based on eighty-eight articles―into how creativity can be stimulated and supported by attending to each of these components. The literature teaches us how to utilize, evaluate, and strategize about creativity in organizational settings. Managers are advised to advance creativity and ideation processes, for example by building virtual environments that strengthen collaboration and creativity across organizational boundaries. Researchers are encouraged to investigate the relationship between strategy and information systems (IS) usage in fostering creativity.

%X Patient-centered care is a relatively new form of healthcare that empowers people when they receive services, but patients must get ready for the active roles they are going to play in order to participate. Based on a literature review, this study conceptualizes that patient-centered care readiness has two basic capabilities: (1) health information access and (2) coordination and communication. The development of these capabilities, leading to the ultimate objective of patient choice and empowerment, depends on the status of health digital inclusion. To maximize the benefits of patient-centered care and reduce the risk of health disparity, it is necessary to assess the patient-centered care readiness of a population, especially to find out who is at a disadvantage. Using the 2009 U.S. National Health Interview Survey data, this study conducts logistic regression and classification tree analyses to predict the two capabilities with eleven physiological, population, socioeconomic, and healthcare-related variables. The results suggest that there is an uneven development of patient-centered care readiness in the country, especially for those who are socially and economically disadvantaged, such as minority people and senior citizens. The findings provide researchers and practitioners the insights on how to cross the gap and prepare the whole nation for the transition.

%X With rapid improvements in technology, the ever-pressing need to reduce healthcare costs, and continuing legislation emphasizing medical reforms, the demand for research within the healthcare/information systems interface is growing. In this study, we ascertain the prevalent themes from the extant medical informatics literature in an effort to motivate research beyond the traditional domain of health information technology research so information systems scholars can better understand where their expertise might contribute to advancements in healthcare. We used a quantitative content analysis method to systematically explore 2,188 article texts from journals in medical informatics, medicine, and MIS published over a ten-year period. Texts were analyzed using centering resonance analysis and factor analysis and the following themes emerged from the literature: Analytics; Healthcare Operations and Standards (with sub-themes: Operations, Project Management, and Information Assurance); Knowledge Transfer/Communication (with sub-themes: Extending beyond the Organization, Internal to the Organization, and Patient-Provider); Perceptions and Managing Expectations of Information Technology; Advancements in Research; and Software as a Service. In this article, we discuss these themes in greater detail and offer directions for future research.

However, subsets of the model can also provide reasonable predictions where all measures are not available.

%X In this research, the authors examine members’ decisions to continue using social networking sites. Site use leads to the growth of social relationships, increased volume of site traffic, and an accumulation of user-generated contents; hence, it is imperative to the long-term success of social networking sites. Drawing on the Theory of Consumption Value, we develop a research model to examine the key values that members derive from networking sites. This model systematically identifies functional, social, epistemic, emotional, and conditional values and contends that these values influence members’ continued site-use decisions. In addition, the research model captures the major determinants of the five value constructs as stemming from networking service attributes, member personalities, website designs, and computing environment. The research model was empirically validated through survey data collected from social networking site users, and the analysis results provided strong support to the hypothesized relationships. The current study generates new knowledge on the literature of social networking sites; it also sheds light on site management for networking service providers.

%X American Power Conversion (APC) was formed in 1981 by three MIT graduates. Its business scope has evolved from standard uninterruptible power supply systems (UPS) products to customized products to full data center solutions. Its name has become synonymous with UPS. Currently, it is part of the European multinational firm Schneider Electric. APC has always been at the cutting edge of using information systems. This case study covers the evolution of their marketing communication function using information technology. They began with implementing database-driven marketing, which was supplemented with Siebel CRM. In order to exploit the marketing data that this platform was generating, they implemented a business intelligence platform. They have developed a collaborative project execution application to drive relationship building with business partners. The case describes the challenges APC has faced in exploiting the power of social media channels and integrating them into existing operations.

%X The importance of culture in helping explain and understand behavior is generally accepted. Scholars in the area of information security have argued that security culture is a key factor in safeguarding information assets. Scholars in the area of professional culture have argued that differences in cultures across professions must be accounted for, in correctly assessing the influence of culture. Combining these arguments, we suggest that differences in security cultures across professions need to be examined to fully comprehend the influences of security culture. The current study uses a qualitative approach to further the understanding of information security cultures across four professions: Information Systems, Accounting, Human Resources, and Marketing. The concept of security culture is articulated, and the security cultures of the four professions are characterized to demonstrate that there are significant variations in security culture across these professions. The study also shows that information security continues to be viewed as a technical problem, that even the most conservative and rule-compliant groups may violate security rules under performance pressure, and that awareness by itself is not sufficient to build a strong security culture.

%X Crowdsourcing is an emerging trend of using the crowd to solve organizational tasks that can offer companies various benefits. However, companies often have difficulty realizing value from crowdsourcing partly because of a lack of knowledge about what kind of crowdsourcing approach will fit their tasks. Also, companies need to understand how to codify task requirements and what incentives to provide to the crowd for different types of tasks. Given the absence of prior research to answer these questions, this article aims to address this knowledge gap. Deriving from the literature, we identified three crowdsourcing approaches and two characteristics to categorize tasks that can determine the appropriate approach. We then performed an analysis of eighty successful tasks from eight popular crowdsourcing websites to understand the appropriate approaches and task specification requirements for the tasks. We also interviewed sixteen participants (two from each website) to identify the motivations for solving different kinds of tasks. Based on the analysis, we propose a framework to match task types with appropriate crowdsourcing approaches, requirement specificity, and motivations of the crowd. Accordingly, we provide guidelines to companies on how to select the appropriate crowdsourcing mechanism for each type of task.

%X Personal information and communication technologies (ICTs) have become commonplace. Today many people own, or have access to, a range of different computing and communication devices, information technologies, and services, which they incorporate into their everyday routines. Increasingly, these technologies impact the way that individuals work, socialize, and play. Workers are bringing their personal ICTs to the office, and organizations are tailoring their computing environments toward ubiquitous integration with personal ICTs. These developments are opening up new ways of working, but they also create new challenges for organizations in accommodating this “nonaffiliated” use as part of their information systems environments. In this article we propose a framework for analyzing the composition and impact of personal ICT ensembles. The framework is positioned as pre-theory that invites further development and empirical testing. We illustrate how the proposed framework could be applied to consider personal ICT use across the work/home context. Several implications stemming from the notion of a personal ICT ensemble are highlighted, including practical considerations for nonaffiliated use in organizations. We conclude with suggestions for further development of the proposed framework.

%X This article presents a technical approach to acquiring quality, real-time decision-making information within organizations and illustrates this approach with an extended case study. Using relational model bases for real-time, operational decision making in organizations facilitates a transition to dynamic (vs. forecast-driven) resource allocation decisions. These and related systems offer development of a new generation of DSS applications which can be applied to extend preemptive decision making across many industries. This approach is illustrated through a description of a detailed conceptual case (scenario) pertaining to its application in agribusiness. This approach to decision making can be viewed as an extension of well-known techniques pertaining to DSS but also represents the opportunity to address problems not amenable to traditional post hoc analysis. Researchers can learn from the accumulated knowledge pertaining to DSS but can also examine innovations that push forward into new territories. The article presents and discusses a variety of emergent research questions prompted by the application of these technologies in the business environment.

%X Microfinance provides financial services to the extremely poor who are not served by banks. At the heart of microfinance is microcredit which provides small loans to the unbanked poor to seed small local businesses. Microfinance may help alleviate poverty because access to finance has a positive impact on economic development. The unmet need of the poor for financial services spawned over 11,000 microfinance institutions (MFIs) by 2010, but 90 percent of these MFIs are small with fewer than 10,000 clients. This article presents three case examples of MFIs in India that deployed information systems (IS) to increase the scale of their operations. Each example illustrates how IS helped MFIs achieve financial sustainability through scaling despite the necessity of using “door-step banking” which requires the MFI’s agents to visit clients in remote areas. By presenting microfinance examples that impact the economic empowerment of the poor, this article addresses the dearth of research on the use of IS to effect social change at the bottom of the pyramid. The article’s subject matter also provides engaging material for IS coursework and teaching.

For example, Swanson concludes that current theory explains little about IS innovation; Avgerou describes it as a relatively unexplored subject, and Fichman identifies signs of exhaustion in the current research agenda. The result of our analysis is an adaptation of ecological systems theory (EST) in order to apply it to the IS innovation landscape. We then build on the theoretical framework to propose an agenda for future research in terms of research directions, research themes, and study designs. Finally, implications for researchers and practitioners are discussed.

%X Business Process Management (BPM) is accepted globally as an organizational approach to enhance productivity and drive cost efficiencies. Studies confirm a shortage of BPM skilled professionals with limited opportunities to develop the required BPM expertise. This study investigates this gap starting from a critical analysis of BPM courses offered by Australian universities and training institutions. These courses were analyzed and mapped against a leading BPM capability framework to determine how well current BPM education and training offerings in Australia address the core capabilities required by BPM professionals globally. To determine the BPM skill-sets sought by industry, online recruitment advertisements were collated, analyzed, and mapped against this BPM capability framework. The outcomes provide a detailed overview on the alignment of available BPM education/training and industry demand. These insights are useful for BPM professionals and their employers to build awareness of the BPM capabilities required for a BPM mature organization. Universities and other training institutions will benefit from these results by understanding where demand is, where the gaps are, and what other BPM education providers are supplying. This structured comparison method could continue to provide a common ground for future discussion across university-industry boundaries and continuous alignment of their respective practices.

%X The growing complexity and high rate of change in the technological and business environments, paired with resource constraints faced by educational institutions, make it difficult for IS programs to offer in-depth education across the variety of topics comprising the IS discipline. Specialization may be an effective way for IS educators to provide rigorous education, while incorporating material related to the latest technological and business developments. This opinion essay considers the area of business analysis as one such area of specialization. The essay examines the place of business analysis in IS research and practice, as well as the current state of business analysis coverage in IS curriculum. Recommendations regarding strengthening the area of business analysis are provided, including the creation of a stand-alone business analysis course in IS curriculum, defining business analysis as a specialization area or career track, and strengthening ties with professional associations.

%X In December 2012, the AIS Special Interest Group on Decision Support, Knowledge and Data Management Systems (SIGDSS) and the Teradata University Network (TUN) cosponsored the Business Intelligence Congress 3 and conducted surveys to assess academia’s response to the growing market need for students with Business Intelligence (BI) and Business Analytics (BA) skill sets. This panel report describes the key findings and best practices that were identified, with an emphasis on what has changed since the BI Congress efforts in 2009 and 2010. The article also serves as a “call to action” for universities regarding the need to respond to emerging market needs in BI/BA, including “Big Data.” The IS field continues to be well positioned to be the leader in creating the next generation BI/BA workforce. To do so, we believe that IS leaders need to continuously refine BI/BA curriculum to keep pace with the turbulent BI/BA marketplace.

%X The transition from information systems (IS) doctoral student to new faculty member is usually accompanied by a sense of satisfaction. The transition takes place on the heels of a significant investment of time, energy, and financial sacrifice for most students. While landing a new faculty position is generally viewed in itself as a huge achievement, new faculty members face plenty of challenges. The FIRST+ framework we present here details the key elements of transitioning from student to faculty and serves as a basis for sharing experiences among soon-to-be graduates and junior faculty members regarding this transition. This paper presents the FIRST+ framework, a panel discussion on the topic led by this paper’s authors at the 2013 Americas Conference on Information Systems in Chicago, and subsequent analysis of AACSB data on PhD degrees conferred and new faculty hires in IS and other business disciplines. The analysis indicates that PhD graduates in all disciplines encountered a decrease in faculty job placement opportunities in 2009 and 2010, but that IS PhD graduates were especially hard hit. The good news for IS PhD graduates and challenge for faculty selection committees is that a resurgence in the job market has occurred since.

%X The emerging research area of eParticipation can be characterized as the study of technology-facilitated citizen participation in (democratic) deliberation and decision-making.  Using conventional literature study techniques, we identify 105 articles that are considered to be highly relevant to eParticipation.  We develop a definitional schema that suggests different ways of understanding an emerging socio-technical research area and use this schema to map the research contributions identified.  This allows us make an initial sketch of the scientific character of the area and its central concerns, theories, and methods.  We extend the analysis to define four central research challenges for the field: understanding technology and participation; the strategic challenge; the design challenge; and the evaluation challenge.  This article thus contributes to a developing account of eParticipation, which will help future researchers both to navigate the research area and to focus their research agendas.

%X Component-based software development (CBD) is a potential breakthrough for software engineering. Unified Modeling Language (UML) can potentially facilitate CBD design and modeling. Although many research projects concentrate on the conceptual interrelation of UML and CBD, few incorporate actual component frameworks into the discussion, which is critical for real-world software system design and modeling. This paper reviews component-based development, including the use of UML for modeling CBD. The paper then discusses the means by which UML extension mechanisms can be used to better support the popular component framework -- CORBA. Two other important component frameworks, DCOM and Web Services, are also discussed.

%X Consumer adoption of mobile payment (m-payment) solutions is low compared to the acceptance of traditional forms of payments. Motivated by this fact, we propose and test a “trust-theoretic model for consumer adoption of m-payment systems.” The model, grounded in literature on “technology adoption” and “trust,” not only theorizes the role of consumer trust in m-payment adoption, but also identifies the facilitators for consumer trust in m-payment systems. It proposes two broad dimensions of trust facilitators: “mobile service provider characteristics” and “mobile technology environment characteristics.” The model is empirically validated via a sample of potential adopters in Singapore. In contrast to other contexts, results suggest the overarching importance of “consumer trust in m-payment systems” as compared to other technology adoption factors. Further, differential importance of the theorized trust facilitators of “perceived reputation” and “perceived opportunism” of the mobile service provider, and “perceived environmental risk” and “perceived structural assurance” of the mobile technology, are also highlighted. A series of post-hoc analyses establish the robustness of the theorized configuration of constructs. Subsequent, sub-group analyses highlight the differential significance of trust facilitators for different user sub-groups. Implications for research and practice emerging out of this study are also discussed.

%X Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) advocates for a holistic view of IT costs across the enterprise over time, grouped into a series of direct and indirect cost elements. Knowing the full costs allows organizations to make optimal decisions regarding the enhancement, retirement, renewal, and/or replacement of critical IT assets. The authors convened a focus group of senior IT managers who were asked to describe their firm’s adoption of TCO, TCO processes, tools to assist with TCO implementations, the effectiveness of these tools, and the governance practices which guide their TCO processes. The group concluded that TCO, despite facing significant implementation challenges, remains a concept worth pursuing. This article reviews current literature, summarizes the focus group discussion, and offers practical guidance for those IT managers considering adopting TCO.

%X This case is set in the market for Internet telephony software, which emerged as the result of the convergence of traditional telecommunications technology with new Internet-based speech technology. Clyp is the provider of a software-based IP-PBX, a public branch exchange, which allows companies to set up and self-manage an internal IP-based telephony network, whereby telephony and data share the same computer network infrastructure. Clyp finds itself confronted with an increasingly competitive and converging market. Its growth rates have fallen behind market average, and its product hasn’t seen innovative changes for some time. The case is targeted at Postgraduate (master’s-level) students in (business) information systems and strategic (technology) management. Its main aim is to facilitate learning on strategic positioning and business model analysis in the faces of converging technology markets and the unique characteristics of a software company. The case lends itself to a three-step analysis: (1) business model analysis, (2) market analysis and strategic positioning, (3) identification of strategic options.

%X By 2010, cloud computing had become established as a new model of IT provisioning for service providers. New market players and businesses emerged, threatening the business models of established market players. This teaching case explores the challenges arising through the impact of the new cloud computing technology on an established, multinational IT service provider called ITSP. Should the incumbent vendors adopt cloud computing offerings? And, if so, what form should those offerings take? The teaching case focuses on the strategic dimensions of technological developments, their threats and opportunities. It requires strategic decision making and forecasting under high uncertainty. The critical question is whether cloud computing is a disruptive technology or simply an alternative channel to supply computing resources over the Internet. The case challenges students to assess this new technology and plan ITSP’s responses.

%X An Information Systems (IS) design research project is in many aspects fundamentally different from that of traditional behaviorist research. IS design research projects with the ambition to provide socio-technical solutions to real world problems require the contribution of external stakeholders to the development, testing, and implementation of the design contribution. This article analyzes socio-technical IS design research from a resource dependency perspective. Our objective is to identify and describe critical resources that need to be secured for completion of the research. We investigate three socio-technical IS design research projects. The first project is a small-scale project on design of eLearning courses, the second is a medium-scale industry-driven project on IS integration in corporate mergers and acquisitions, and the third is a large collaborative research project with the ambition to redesign European customs using IT. The most prominent resources are human (knowledge and skills) and organizational (reputation and trust). The main strategy to deal with dependencies is incorporation of resource controllers, which create reciprocal and sequential dependencies internally. Our study shows the importance of extending the existing view of IS design research, when applied to socio-technical research, with an “initiation phase” and an “impact phase,” which are especially important in large-scale design research projects.

%X Information technologies are an integral part of any organization and are constantly emerging and evolving. Theories explaining the impact of technological innovations on organizations and the individuals that populate them are developed as new technologies emerge, and future business applications are explored. Despite this richness of research, we have a fairly narrow view of how these technologies are related. Furthermore, new technologies are often assigned labels that strongly connote disconnect from existing technologies despite the fact that few true evolutionary leaps exist and, for the most part, information technologies evolve from each other and share many similarities. Consequently, our ability to apply knowledge gained from the application of one technology to interactions with another is limited. Developing general theories of information technologies require strong understanding of the different technologies that exist and how they are related. To this end, this article puts forward a concise classification of information technologies. Using a multidimensional scaling approach and survey data from IS academics, we identify three dimensions which capture the commonalities and differences among information technologies. We believe that the resultant classification will enable researchers to better integrate existing and future theories, and to move away from technology-specific theories toward more general ones.

%X Mainstream literature recognizes the validity and effectiveness of use cases as a technique for gathering and capturing system requirements. Use cases represent the driver of various modern development methods, mainly of object-oriented extraction, such as the Unified Process. Although the adoption of use cases proliferated in the context of software systems development, they are not as extensively employed in business modeling. The concept of business use case is not a novelty, but only recently did it begin to re-circulate in the literature and in case tools.  This paper examines the issues involved in adopting business use cases for capturing the functionality of an organization and proposes guidelines for their identification, packaging, and mapping to system use cases. The proposed guidelines are based on the principle of actor perception described in the paper. The application of this principle is exemplified with a worked example aimed at demonstrating the utility of the proposed guidelines and at clarifying the application of the principle of actor perception. The worked example is based on a series of workshops run at a major UK financial institution.

%X Although a growing number of business graduates are involved in the selection, implementation, and use of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, many schools are slow in adopting and integrating these systems into their business curricula. Anecdotal evidence suggests that many schools perceive the integration of ERP software into curricula to be too complex, and the resulting costs to outweigh the benefits derived.  Other schools question the relevance of ERP skills and knowledge to students. However, an increasing number of schools are joining ERP vendor alliance programs, offering ERP tracks in various departments or even building their business programs around ERP software.  The apparent divergence of opinions regarding incorporating ERP into business curricula lends itself to a fruitful area of inquiry.  The current study presents the results of a survey administered to information systems faculty at 94 colleges and universities that examines the current status of ERP integration in the classroom. All but three of these schools are in the US. Topics addressed in the survey include extent of ERP use in the classroom, reasons why schools did not adopt ERP for teaching purposes, implementation issues, and pedagogical uses. In addition, based on the authors' recent experiences in implementing ERP for classroom use, benefits and challenges of ERP integration into curricula are discussed.   The study's results are informative to those schools wanting to benchmark their efforts against other schools, as well as to non-adopting schools that are considering undertaking this initiative.

%X Information and communication systems are now breeding grounds for electronic-evidence (e-evidence) in audits, investigations, or litigation. Increasingly organizations are being ordered by law or lawsuit to preserve, retrieve, and hand-over relevant electronic records (e-records) because "the courts are uniformly recognizing the discoverability of electronic communication and documents" [Nimsger and Lange, 2002]. This trend is an outgrowth of aggressive tactics by regulators to ensure corporate accountability and deter fraud.  In cases ranging from Securities and Exchange Commission probes of corporate malfeasance and insider trading to employment lawsuits, e-records are subpoenaed. Investigations conducted by the National Association of Security Dealers, Department of Justice, and Department of Homeland Security routinely require companies, their business partners, or third parties to preserve and disclose e-records, including internal e-mail and instant messages (IM). A high-profile example is the probe into alleged White House leaks of a covert CIA agent's identity in which White House employees received e-mail stating: ''You must preserve all materials that might in any way be related to the department's investigation.'' E-mail, telephone logs, and other electronic documents were mentioned specifically.   Any communication or file storage device is subject to computer forensic searches to identify, examine, and preserve potential e-evidence--the electronic equivalent of a "smoking gun." Preserving e-records and then restoring them so that they can be searched can seriously disrupt IS and over-burden Information Systems staff. What's more, a preservation order might specify not only the type of e-records (data files or email), but also stipulate that processes that over-write data be suspended, or that backup tapes be retained for unspecified duration. These stipulations are very disruptive to IS operations. That disruption depends largely on whether the company had an e-record management (ERM) system to systemically review, retain, and destroy e-records received or created in the course of business. This article presents an overview of e-evidence and computer forensics and their implications for Information Systems. It aims to encourage research into ERM and fully-indexed, searchable e-mail archives by providing compelling reasons for how these approaches mitigate e-evidence risks and cost. These research issues are important for several reasons. Rarely are IS departments prepared for the challenges that evidentiary rules impose on active and archival data operations. Retaining unessential e-records increases costs and risks. Companies may need to justify their e-record retention and destruction policies as proof of compliance with their accounting, regulatory, or legal obligations. Courts impose severe sanctions on employers who claim they are unable to comply with e-record requests because of Information Systems design flaws or sloppy e-records management if it obstructs an investigation.

%X Changing business practices and expectations suggest it may be time to rethink the contents and emphases of the introductory information systems course typically required of all undergraduate business majors.  With increasing business emphases on processes and revived interest within schools of business on integration of functional common body of knowledge (CBK) content, an alternative to the traditional IS course seems desirable.  This article presents an approach that enhances students' understanding of the entirety of business operations and their critical interdependencies.  They learn about business processes, how later CBK courses and functions relate to processes, and how IT and IS are critical to development of effective processes.  It is argued that this approach adds more value to the general business student than the required course (2002.1) in the IS 2002 Curriculum of AIS.  Further, it is argued that a new approach could strengthen faculty and student perceptions about the importance of IS in the core curriculum in schools of business.

%X During the 1990s, businesses began relying on the convenience of ubiquitous computer systems and on the efficiencies of digital networks.  This new techno-economic dynamic prompted White House administrations of the 1990s to take note of public policy issues surrounding the "information superhighway" and the "digital divide." Yet, because the digital world seems intangible, relatively few policymakers connected the virtual world with its potential impact on the physical world [Frye, 2002].   A case study of a community organizing program was conducted to examine the digital divide in the United States and its connection to other factors.  This field study of computer-illiterate people in a public housing community was undertaken to better understand the complexities of the "have vs. have not" divide so that effective public policies can be deployed to bridge the gap.  Community members ran this program with assistance from volunteers and set their own technology learning plan to minimize their techno-disadvantage.  Overall, the results indicate the importance of a community-driven organizing strategy.  Even though the program was effective in that participants learned computers skills, their emotional state declined.  Becoming computer literate did not eliminate feelings of isolation from mainstream society, which is considered a factor contributing to the divide.  Those who are adversely digitally divided may also be divided by a culture of failure.  Bridging the digital divide requires a more comprehensive approach--and not a quick fix.  It requires a process that is, for example, driven by a local community program and strategy to initiate and sustain members' use of technology.

%X This paper examines in detail the meaning of two frequently used terms, namely, "business model" and "strategy".  It is argued that as used by leading thinkers these two terms might reasonably be interpreted as being roughly equivalent in meaning. However, we argue that the term "business model"  serves another distinct and potentially useful role. In this role, a business model is viewed as an abstraction of a firm's Porter-1996 strategy.  It outlines the essential details of a firm's value proposition for its various stakeholders and the activity system the firm uses to create and deliver value to its customers.  However, unlike strategy, business models do not consider a firm's competitive positioning; they potentially apply to many firms.  Such abstractions, it is argued, attracted the attention of many researchers because they are useful for evaluating alternative possible future ways of building profitable businesses.

%X EDITOR'S FOREWORD: This article differs from  the articles CAIS published previously in that it is a debate on the nature of IT written by practitioners from three different points of view. It deals with IT Doesn't Matter, a polemic written by Nicholas Carr, then editor of the Harvard Business Review  in which he argued that the days when IT offered strategic advantage are long since gone and that managers therefore should undertake a different approach to IT.  The paper, obviously, became notorious in the IS community.  On December 3, 2003, the Southern California Chapter of the Society for Information Management, at its regular meeting invited three of its members with long experience as chief information officers to debate the issue. The title of the meeting was: "I.T. Doesn't Matter or Does It? How to Improve the Value and Perception of I.T." The three debaters were assigned a position to argue: favorable to Carr (Laskey), neutral (DeJarnett), and unfavorable to Carr (Trainor). Edited versions of their remarks are presented below.

This paper studies the capabilities of IS professionals from the USA and Taiwan on issues such as performance, time spent on IS related activities, and required skills vs. skills possessed. The goal is to determine the differences among these two groups in their core IT capabilities and to offer practitioners an empirical reference for carrying out their IS development decisions. Findings from the current study indicate that Taiwanese professionals tended to focus more on the technical issues and hardware/software details, while American professionals were proficient in business modeling, inter-personal communication, and end-user training. These findings present an opportunity for partnership between the two countries to develop low-cost but high quality IS projects. Other business implications are also discussed.

%X Providing personalized services for mobile commerce (m-commerce) can improve user satisfaction and merchant profits, which are important to the success of m-commerce. This paper proposes a Bayesian network (BN)-based framework for personalization in m-commerce applications. The framework helps to identify the target mobile users and to deliver relevant information to them at the right time and in the right way. Under the framework, a personalization model is generated using a new method and the model is implemented in an m-commerce application for the food industry. The new method is based on function dependencies of a relational database and rough set operations. The framework can be applied to other industries such as movies, CDs, books, hotel booking, flight booking, and all manner of shopping settings.

An important recent innovation in these areas is the deployment of separate networks dedicated to server administration and related tasks, combining the cost and productivity advantages of remote administration with risk levels comparable to console-based administrative access.  Remote server administration is a previously undocumented artisanal tradition that evolved in scientific and technical network environments, and is now becoming applicable to an increasing range of business networks.  This tutorial article provides an overview of current server administration network architectures, and of the software, workstation, and user interface technologies associated with remote server administration.

%X In 1999, Rose et al. identified six categories of technological impediments inhibiting the growth of electronic commerce: (1) download delays, (2) interface limitations, (3) search problems, (4) inadequate measures of Web application success, (5) security, and (6) a lack of Internet standards.  This paper updates findings in the original paper by surveying the practitioner literature for the five-year period from June 1999 to June 2004.  We identify how advances in technology both partially resolve concerns with the original technological impediments, and inhibit their full resolution.  We find that, despite five years of technological progress, the six categories of technological impediments remain relevant.  Furthermore, the maturation of e-Commerce increased the Internet's complexity, making these impediments harder to address.  Two kinds of complexity are especially relevant: 	evolutionary complexity, and  	skill complexity.    Evolutionary complexity refers to the need to preserve the existing Internet and resolve impediments simultaneously.  Unfortunately, because the Internet consists of multiple incompatible technologies, philosophies, and attitudes, additions to the Internet infrastructure are difficult to integrate.  Skill complexity refers to the skill sets necessary for managing e-Commerce change.  As the Internet evolves, more skills become relevant.  Unfortunately, individuals, companies and organizations are unable to master and integrate all necessary skills.  As a result, new features added to the Internet do not consider all relevant factors, and are thus sub-optimal. NOTE THAT THIS ARTICLE IS APPROXIMATELY 600kb.

%X Rapid advances in technology profoundly affect the way businesses are conducted and the way industry structures evolved.  The air travel distribution industry experienced two major technology waves in its evolution, the Computer Reservations System (CRS) and electronic commerce. This paper considers various frameworks used to explain structural features of the US air travel distribution industry and the competitive forces within it.  We then describe the historical context within which the structural changes occurred as a result of IT innovations. The current and relative strengths of the industry forces are examined to explain an IT-induced power shift in the industry.  We then consider the impact of IT on the air travel distribution industry in the Asia-Pacific region.   Based on a comparison with the US experience, we forecast that variances in geography, culture and psychology will limit the extent to which IT can be used to manipulate the balance of power in the industry in the short- to medium-term.  We expect, however, that a uniform industry structure will prevail in the long-run.

%X Strategic alignment focuses on the activities that management performs to achieve cohesive goals across the IT (Information Technology) and other functional organizations (e.g., finance, marketing, H/R, manufacturing). Therefore, alignment addresses both how IT is in harmony with the business, and how the business should, or could be in harmony with IT.  Alignment evolves into a relationship where the function of IT and other business functions adapt their strategies together.  Achieving alignment is evolutionary and dynamic.  It requires strong support from senior management, good working relationships, strong leadership, appropriate prioritization, trust, and effective communication, as well as a thorough understanding of the business and technical environments.  Achieving and sustaining alignment demands focusing on maximizing the enablers and minimizing the inhibitors that cultivate alignment. The strategic alignment maturity assessment provides organizations with a vehicle to evaluate these activities. Knowing the maturity of its strategic choices and alignment practices make it possible for a firm to see where it stands and how it can improve.  This paper  discusses an approach for assessing the maturity of the business-IT alignment.  Once maturity is understood, an organization can identify opportunities for enhancing the harmonious relationship of business and IT.

%X IS educators often struggle with curriculum issues including timeliness and completeness of the curriculum. While model curricula suggest that programming courses should be a part of an IS undergraduate degree, little guidance is offered as to the order and timing of these courses. A longitudinal survey of students in programming courses was used to assess whether sequence or concurrency explained any variance in perceptual performance measures. Sequence of programming courses did not hinder student performance, and concurrency actually improved performance for Visual Basic. Insights from the study provide guidance for curricular design issues regarding the sequencing and timing of programming courses.

%X The IS field prides itself on its closeness to practice and needs to ensure its relevance under growing pressures from governments and business for improved utilisation of research results. In this paper we consider choice-making in the research activity from the perspective of Resource-Dependence Theory, with a particular focus on the choice of target audience for research results. IS academic leaders in UK universities were interviewed to gain insights into the influences affecting their choices, taking a broad view of the research context and process, the researchers themselves, and the stakeholders of IS research. The paper aims to provide insights for IS researchers as they reflect on their own individual practice of research and to encourage the explicit inclusion of Resource-Dependence Theory into stakeholder analysis within IS theory. For practitioners it should provide some illumination on the world of academia.

%X Accreditation guidelines usually dictate that information technology resources and systems shall be essential components of the university infrastructure.  But, what is the competitive advantage of universities born in the information-age and the Internet revolution?  As a Florida's newest public university, Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU) is known for its strategic use of technology and innovation, including use of information technology for distance learning delivery as well as internal administration and student-service processes.  At FGCU, information technology is intertwined with academic and administrative operations, such as curriculum-design, course-delivery, resource-allocation, and everyday decision-making.  The objective of this paper is to examine the developmental decisions, including policy, computer hardware and software, communications networks, and user services that led to the University's accreditation in record time.  It illustrates sample technology-driven course-delivery tools like the WebClassroom of the Future.  The paper examines the outcomes, problems and solutions and provides a framework for next-generation universities.

%X This paper proposes an inductive data mining technique (named GPR) based on genetic programming. Unlike other mining systems, the particularity of our technique is its ability to discover business rules that satisfy multiple (and possibly conflicting) decision or search criteria simultaneously. We present a step-by-step method to implement GPR, and introduce a prototype that generates production rules from real life data. We also report in this article on the use of GPR in an organization that seeks to understand how its employees make decisions in a "voluntary separation" program. Using a personnel database of 12,787 employees with 35 descriptive variables, our technique is able to discover employees' hidden decision making patterns in the form of production rules.  As our approach does not require any domain specific knowledge, it can be used without any major modification in different domains.

%X Search engines were crucial in the development of the World Wide Web. Web-based information retrieval progressed from simple word matching to sophisticated algorithms for maximizing the relevance of search results. Statistical and graph-based approaches for indexing and ranking pages, natural language processing techniques for improving query results, and intelligent agents for personalizing the search process all show great promise for enhanced performance.   The evolution in search technology was accompanied by growing economic pressures on search engine companies. Unable to sustain long-term viability from advertising revenues, many of the original search engines diversified into portals that farm out their search and directory operations. Vertical portals that serve focused user communities also outsource their search services, and even directory providers began to integrate search engine technologies from outside vendors.  This article brings order to the chaos resulting from the variety of search tools being offered under various marketing guises. While growing reliance on a small set of search providers is leading to less diversity among search services, users can expect individualized searching experiences that factor in personal information. The convergence of technology and business models also results in more narrowly defined search spaces, which will lessen the quantity of search results while improving their quality.

%X Audience comments about a debate at ICIS200 [Alter et al., 2001] related to e-business and the fundamental concepts of information systems noted that the debate was undercut by the lack of agreement about what are the fundamental concepts. As a follow-on to that debate, this article proposes a set of fundamental concepts for  information systems. While there is no bullet-proof way to prove that a particular set of concepts captures what is truly fundamental within a diverse and rapidly evolving field, the attempt to identify these concepts challenges the reader to ask "If this isn't the way to identify fundamental concepts, what is the way to do that? If these aren't the fundamental concepts, what is a better set of fundamental concepts and why?"  This article's overarching theme is that the fundamental concepts of information systems are mostly fundamental concepts of work systems in general. The article defines "fundamental concept" and discusses various considerations for identifying them. It then proposes a set of fundamental concepts organized in several layers. The first layer  concentrates on the elements needed to summarize a work system. The second layer adds concepts that constitute a general vocabulary for describing, understanding, and evaluating work systems. Each concept in the second layer is related to a specific concept in the first layer. Since an information system is a special case of a work      system, every fundamental concept of work systems should at least apply to information systems and might be a fundamental concept of information systems. Similarly for work system projects and information system projects, both of which are also special cases of work systems. The article argues that the fundamental concepts of work systems            should be viewed as fundamental concepts for all three special cases and then            concludes with a number of questions about that the reader might want to consider            concerning the approach the article takes and the particular fundamental concepts that            are identified.

%X The Information Systems (IS) discipline is over a third of a century old.  It is a multidisciplinary field of study that covers areas related to the management, deployment, and use of information technology.  In response to this extended reach and the growing needs and requirements of its stakeholders, the IS community successfully solidified its foundations through institutionalization and professionalization.  However, in light of a complex patronage structure, undisciplined diversity, and unbounded eclecticism in scholarly activities, the progress of IS as a scientific discipline has been attenuated.  Drawing lessons from the field of psychology, this paper calls for solidifying the disciplinary matrix of IS.  It argues that scientific progress of IS can be advanced further through the development of cumulative and exemplary theories aimed at significant problems.  Such a cumulative approach to research tradition and knowledge unification would help demarcate the boundaries of the IS domain not in terms of its subject matters, but by the theories it develops to solve the problems within its domain.

%X Based on the common elements in the definitions and operationalizations of knowledge management and the learning organization, a triad of objectives for both knowledge management and the learning organizations is identified: 1)  improved information and knowledge that  enables (2) organizational behaviors and decisions that have greater impacts, and (3) improved organizational performance.  These objectives are used to guide the development of an information/knowledge value chain model that can form the basis for a framework for evaluating progress in knowledge management programs and in the development of a learning organization.  Four classes of evaluation are identified for this purpose  (cognitive and post-cognitive process, behavioral, learning process, and organizational impact) A number of operational measures are suggested for each class.  The measures that are appropriate in a given circumstance may be selected from, or suggested by, that list.

%X The information systems (IS) research relevance debate was sparked by concerns that the research community is delivering products that are only sometimes considered useful.  Symptoms of the problem include the marketability of IS graduates, our failure to lead industry, the proliferation of journals and conferences with overlapping themes, and a rewards system that is geared towards outputs.  Relevance, in my view, is a function of addressing the right problem and packaging the results in a manner suitable for consumption.  My recommendations therefore  include: identifying the fundamental and applied areas; recognizing our limitations in these areas; providing research summaries; clarifying the research channels by avoiding overlaps in conferences and journals; and altering the rewards and control systems such that they are biased towards contribution to the discipline.

%X Information Systems as an academic discipline makes two contributions to society.  The first, knowledge exploration, is the creation of new knowledge that is not -- and should not be -- relevant to today's practitioner.  The goal of knowledge exploration is to change the future, not improve the present.  The second, knowledge exploitation, is the dissemination of knowledge to serve current practice (and to train future practitioners, our students).  While I believe we have done a good job of knowledge exploration, I believe we need develop new vehicles to promote, nurture, and validate knowledge exploitation much like our academic cousins in Medicine, Engineering, and Computer Science.

%X This article argues that IS research is not relevant to the practitioner community due to the tenure-based reward system.  It shows that long delays between performing research and publishing in a top journal make our research less timely and useful to practitioners.  Teaching and publishing loads give our junior faculty less time to gain practical experience through working with practitioners; and if they do, their focus on the underlying general theory makes them ill prepared to solve specific practitioner problems.  Adjuncts and Lecturers are not solutions.  The tenure system makes these positions second class.  It is suggested that publishing requirements be loosened to allow more of our work to be published in practitioner-oriented or lower level journals and conferences.  Encourage gaining practical experience by broadening what is considered for tenure and consider granting Lecturers tenure.  Finally, shorten publication times by increasing the use of electronic journals and publishing.

%X This paper explores why the virtual university movement may be entering a new phase of development.  This phase is characterized by inter-university coalitions that share information and communication technology (ICT) platforms to develop and deliver  web-based courses.  This collaborative movement is the result of a number of forces driven primarily by the need to address escalating ICT costs and overcome resistance of faculty to distance education initiatives. Complementary resources such as national library databases; Internet-based course materials; low cost, broadband communications; Internet2; and state legislative initiatives are additional drivers facilitating the move toward a collaborative virtual university (CVU) model.   This model is examined as a change agent for universities to reexamine their individual roles in leveraging Internet resources to enhance the quality of higher education programs. Leading edge initiatives are also described.

%X IT infrastructure flexibility is now being viewed as an organizational core competency that is necessary for organizations to survive and prosper in rapidly-changing, competitive, business environments. Using data from 200 U.S. and Canadian companies, this study examines the impact of the four components of IT infrastructure flexibility (compatibility, connectivity, modularity, and IT personnel) on strategic IT-business alignment and the extent to which various applications are implemented within an organization. The “extent” of implementation refers to the the organization’s experience with the particular application and the degree to which the application is implemented and used throughout the organization. The findings from analysis of a structural model provide evidence that connectivity, modularity, and IT personnel (among other considerations that we discuss in the paper) make significant, positive impacts on strategic alignment and that all four components result in significant, positive impacts on the applications implementation. The study reinforces the importance of IT infrastructure flexibility to organizations as one source for sustainable competitive advantage.

Some 3497 citations were made to 251 articles published in MIS Quarterly during 1989-1998.  The study results show that the quality of MIS Quarterly is commensurate with its intended role as a general journal of the specialty IS area.  MIS Quarterly ranks favorably when compared to specialty journals and respectably among general journals of specific disciplines.  Moreover, most research appearing in MIS Quarterly is used by researchers in various disciplines and, thus, contributes to advancing the body of knowledge.

%X C++ and Java are popular programming languages in university programs.  Job postings show that Java and C++ are much in demand technical skills.  In this paper, the human capital model was fitted to estimate the salary benefits of knowing C++ and Java. The analysis is based on survey data for 22,488 full-time information systems professionals.  Based on the results for this model, we conclude that knowledge of Java produces a much greater salary increase than does C++.  Of course, knowledge of both languages is particularly desirable because, as expected, knowledge of both languages results in the largest salary.

%X This article reports the findings of an exploratory study of R/3 users in China which was conducted in Spring 2000. The broad purpose of the study is to identify crucial implementation process and context variables which warrant closer attention in the study of IT-enabled organizational change. As companies display a great variety of ownership structures in China (including state-owned, foreign-invested, and privately-held firms), the role of ownership can be studied in relatively greater depth there than elsewhere. While it turns out that ownership is strongly associated with implementation process characteristics, the association of ownership structures with implementation results is much less pronounced. It was found that project governance, specifically the role and decision making style of the steering committee, can be associated with a broad set of outcome variables after controlling for ownership and other important context factors.

%X Electronic marketplaces are evolving in both business to business, and business to consumer contexts. Although the initial hype surrounding all types of marketplaces appears to overstate their short-term impact, established companies across all types of industrial sectors are entering into collaborative, industry-wide initiatives to agree on common technical and trading standards to improve the effectiveness of the interactions between buyers and sellers on a global scale. An overview of contemporary developments is presented, and common patterns across different sectors are identified. Three case studies are presented in the areas of automotive, banking, and consumer markets. It is shown that product-market characteristics affect the formation of business relationships and market structures, and the design of information flows and shared systems is a reflection of typically strong business relationships and hierarchical market structures.

%X Two of the most commonly used classifications in IS research are the factor approach and the process approach. While many studies of IS implementation are undertaken using a factor approach, little research so far examines the process of e-commerce implementation, especially in relation to the implementation of e-commerce in business-to-business (B2B) relationships. A holistic understanding of implementation which combines both the factor and process approaches using a case study method, is suggested as particularly suitable because of its ability to capture the reality of e-commerce implementation in an organisation's natural environment and in much greater detail than is possible using one of these approaches alone.  In this paper, therefore, we endeavour to contribute to what we perceive as a gap in the body of theory surrounding the implementation process in the business-to-business e-commerce literature.  We describe the findings of multiple case studies involving ten major Australian e-commerce initiators.  In addition to confirming our earlier finding of the importance of non-technical factors for the success of the implementation process we also present, through our case studies, the various management and business issues associated with the success or failure of B2B e-commerce implementation.

%X In spite of many years of effort, we are still not able to articulate and deliver IT value accurately. Unfortunately, "silver bullet thinking" still predominates (i.e., plug in technology and deliver bottom line impact) in organizations today. IT value is a multi-layered concept, far more complex than it first appears. To examine this complex concept and how it is understood in IT organizations, the authors convened a focus group of practicing IT managers from a number of different industries. This paper, using the inputs from the focus group, explores how organizations are attempting to determine and develop effective IT value propositions. It describes the three components of this proposition: identification of potential value, effective conversion, and realizing value. The paper then derives a number of principles of delivering IT value. We conclude that there is no single agreed-on notion of business value. Therefore, it is important to make sure that both business and IT managers work to a common value goal whether traditional cost reduction, process efficiencies, new business capabilities, improved communication, or any other objectives. We also suggest that technology is being used as a catalyst to drive many different types of organizational transformation and strategy. Therefore, IT value can no longer be viewed in isolation from the other parts of business, namely people and information.

Three panellists responded to a set of questions on the meaning of the term globalization to them, and the role of information and communications technologies (ICTs) in globalization processes.  The panellists also highlighted the importance of local diversity in understanding globalization and ICTs, drawing from their varied research in contexts such as western country financial markets, health systems in Guatemala, and e-commerce in Mexico.  A further output of the panel, and this paper, is the identification of key research questions and theories for future IS research in this important area.

%X While there is no shortage of commentary on the nature and impact of the Internet, a deep understanding of this phenomenon and its diffusion must go beyond the collection of factoids, such as the number of hosts and users, to capture the context within which the Internet evolves.  This paper introduces a CAIS series entitled "The Global Diffusion of the Internet," which seeks to promote research efforts that contribute to our understanding of the diffusion of the Internet throughout the world, that create and apply analytic frameworks that permit comparative analyses, and that capture the rather perishable history of the Internet as it unfolds.  Contributions by scholars from parts of the world that are under-represented among the AIS membership are particularly encouraged.

%X With his proclamation in 1998 that "IT is India's tomorrow", Prime Minister Vajpayee captured a vision of a 21st century India substantially different from that of the previous century, with its high levels of poverty, bloated bureaucracies, and protectionist policies. He envisioned the new India as a major IT power, fully integrated with the global economy, bringing about substantial domestic and international benefit.  The Internet is a key to this vision, both as an enabler of technology-based change, and as an indicator of the vision's fulfillment.   Using an analytic framework developed by the authors and others, this study documents the growth of the Internet in India, from the pre-Internet networks through the boom of the Internet from 1998 to 2003. The Indian experience provides an example of how fundamental, focused changes in policy and legislation can unleash forces that accelerate Internet diffusion.  Private sector initiatives greatly expanded the Internet infrastructure and Internet services market.  At the same time, Government initiatives promoted the expansion of the Internet into parts of the country not well served by private ISPs.  Poverty and limited telecommunications infrastructure currently limit the rate and extent of Internet expansion.  However, time is an ally; the basic elements for continued growth of the Internet are largely in place.

%X Enterprise content management (ECM) is an integrated approach to managing all of an organization's information including paper documents, data, reports, web pages, and digital assets. ECM includes the strategies, tools, processes, and skills an organization needs to manage its information assets over their lifecycle. While many vendors would suggest that their software is a panacea, most knowledge managers recognize the greater challenge - to develop an overall ECM strategy that will ensure good information practices are in place and effectively integrated with technology where appropriate. An effective ECM strategy should address each of the four lifecycle stages: 1. Capture - all activities associated with collecting content. 2. Organize - indexing, classifying and linking content and databases together to provide access within and across business units and functions. 3. Process - sifting and analyzing content in ways that inform decision-making. 4. Maintain - ensuring that content is kept up-to-date. A guiding principle at all stages is flexibility. Methods of collecting, organizing, processing and maintaining content that "casts it in concrete" could become a liability in the near future. While the top-down vision for ECM includes improved decision-making, better utilization of information and the collection of competitive intelligence, most ECM initiatives take a bottom-up approach that focuses on delivering immediate benefits through projects such as intranet portals, information searching, and web content management. However, knowledge managers also recognize that greater value can be gained from taking a more strategic approach to ECM. The research shows that those organizations that can marry effective content stewardship practices with appropriate information behaviors and values and information technology on a broader scale can have a significant effect on their organization's performance.

%X The ethical aspects of computing are increasingly being taught and written about in professional information systems education in universities. However, the ever-increasing role and use of computer technology means that computer ethics education related to computing is also necessary for non-professional/non-major computing/information systems students. Owing to the differences between professional and non-professional education, end-users need a different computer ethics program. First, this paper explores some of the issues (goals, challenges and problems to overcome) in end-user ethics teaching. Second, it proposes a solution based on the concept of universalizability. Third, the paper argues that the universalizability thesis is a proper tool for end-user education. Finally it demonstrates, with the help of three cases, how the solution chosen can be used to solve the issues identified and to educate end-users.

While recovery presupposes an event that causes a failure, continuity suggests the avoidance, or at least minimizing, the impact of a failure. Business Continuity Management is not just about Information Systems.  Rather it is about ensuring that the critical business functions can continue. Business Continuity Management is a process not an event and should deal with any threat that could affect the business. For many organizations reliant on sophisticated Information Technology, adequate Business Continuity Management is a basic requirement.

The panel, titled, "IS Research that Really Matters: Beyond the IS Rigor - Relevance Debate," was organized to foster a discussion on conducting IS research that is significant, in terms of impact, and responsible to the needs of stakeholders. To this end, panel members were asked to push the debate on IS research beyond the traditional arguments of rigor and relevance in research towards IS research that reverberates and is responsible. In doing so, the panel members shared their views on the definition of significant research, who are the stakeholders of IS research and what are their needs, and how do we move the field ahead.

The aim of this paper is to organize the literature to provide a clear depiction of what we know and what we don't know about it in order to identify specific areas where future research efforts are needed. A review of the B2C literature of the past seven years yielded 115 papers investigating the phenomenon from the user/customer perspective, 74 of these were empirical. This literature is organized according to the Activity Theory framework, allowing for an enhanced understanding of the phenomenon through a social context perspective. Future research directions are identified and discussed.

It describes how he initiated his project, how he came across action-research, and how he slowly evolved in his search for coherence until he felt he could progress confidently. The paper is mainly intended to offer to readers who are unfamiliar with action-research a context where they can become aware of some of the difficulties of its use how they can be solved, and recognize some criteria that can be met to ensure that the results obtained are scientifically valid. The paper concludes by reflecting on the close relationship between action-research and the epis¬temology of the information systems field, suggesting that this relationship should be the object of further exploration.

%X Equity across academic disciplines is taken for granted in contemporary business schools. The status of a discipline is crucial for such fairness.  One might assume, therefore, that IS scholars are treated fairly during tenure and promotion processes when compared to scholars from other business school academic fields.  In fact, to the extent that the IS field has short and long term problems, this may not be the case.  The playing field used by business academic disciplines may not be level. This study addresses three questions related to this issue.  The first asks whether there is a level playing field for publication among the various business disciplines, and second, assuming a level playing field, what are the relative productivity differences between dissemination of scientific results among these disciplines?   The third question is how could the playing field be leveled, assuming it is not at the present time. To answer these questions, existing data sources were tapped, one of these containing well over 18,000 data points.  Further, original data was gathered from U.S. business schools, and all the data was analyzed in relation to AACSB data on the relative sizes of business school disciplines.  Given our finding that the playing field is not level, the differences between the IS discipline and the other disciplines - Accounting, Finance, Management, and Marketing - are examined, and the consequences of the disadvantage to the IS discipline are discussed.  The article concludes with recommendations of actions to level the field, and these are presented as a challenge to leaders in the Information Systems discipline.

This article elaborates and extends several concepts that lay the foundation for thinking about next-generation information requirements. Specifically, four information drivers are identified that form the underlying cornerstones of our ideas. These drivers, which we call the u-constructs, euphonically comprise ubiquity, uniqueness, universality, and unison.

%X The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) forced corporations to examine their spreadsheet use in financial reporting. Corporations do not like what they are seeing. Surveys conducted in response to SOX show that spreadsheets are used widely in corporate financial reporting. Spreadsheet error research, in turn, shows that nearly all large spreadsheets contain multiple errors and that errors of material size are quite common. The first round of Sarbanes-Oxley assessments confirmed concerns about spreadsheet accuracy. Another concern is spreadsheet fraud, which also exists in practice and is easy to perpetrate. Unfortunately, few organizations maintain effective controls to deal with either errors or fraud. This paper examines spreadsheet risks for Sarbanes-Oxley (and other regulations) and discusses how general and IT-specific control frameworks can be used to address the control risks created by spreadsheets.

%X Fourth generation wireless systems (4G) are likely to reach the consumer market in another 4-5 years. 4G comes with the promise of increased bandwidth, higher speeds, greater interoperability across communication protocols, and user friendly, innovative, and secure applications. In this article, I list the requirements of the 4G systems by considering the needs of the users in the future. These requirements can be met if technical and business challenges can be overcome. Technical challenges include mobility management, quality of service, interoperability, high data rate, security, survivability, spectrum, intelligent mobile devices, middleware, and network access. I discuss the most plausible solutions to these technical challenges in this paper. Business-related challenges include billing, payment methods, pricing, size of investments, content provision and mediation, and the trade-off between richness and reach. If these technical and business challenges can be met, then 4G will become the next frontier in data and voice communication infrastructure.

%X In the past, IT was only marginally affected by regulatory matters. Today, however, IT is in the middle of a whirlwind of corporate governance reforms. New standards for internal controls are affecting almost every aspect of IT work. These, in turn, have significant implications on how IT is managed and on IT costs and productivity. For example, many IT organizations have been so involved in developing and implementing Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) procedures that very little has actually been accomplished for the business itself. This paper explores how new compliance frameworks and governance reforms, mandated by governments and/or industry groups, are changing IT work. It examines what IT managers perceive to be most significant issues these reforms present IT in their particular organizations. This paper is not designed to provide detailed information about IT controls and how to achieve them. Instead, it is intended to be a general introduction to the changing expectations of IT and how these are affecting IT work, structure and governance. It looks at the new effects regulatory issues are having in IT, and then examines the key issues IT managers face in an increasingly regulated environment. Next, it identifies the key areas within IT that are affected and the types of activities that need to be addressed by managers in order to achieve effective controls. Finally some recommended good practices are presented. The authors conclude that there is no question that new laws and regulations governing organizations, their finances and their information are having a huge impact on IT. IT managers are struggling to implement new controls and document existing ones, while still ensuring business as usual and trying to develop the new systems their companies need. The world is requiring IT to become thoroughly professional about what it does. The IT of the future will therefore of necessity be increasingly controlled, standardized and bureaucratized. It remains to be seen whether or not management will be able to use this "new and improved" IT for competitive advantage.

%X With the wide-spread adoption of Enterprise Systems (ES), such as SAP, Oracle, and Peoplesoft, in medium and large-sized organizations, there is increasing demand for students who know how to work with such systems. While the demand for ES developers and integrators has declined, the demand for employees that can help companies achieve benefits from these systems continues to grow. Such employees need skills in decision-making and process design in an integrated, data-rich environment enabled by an ES. This paper provides advice about teaching with enterprise systems at the undergraduate and graduate levels within the IS curriculum and across management and engineering curricula. This advice is provided by five professors from five different schools, California State University at Chico, Louisiana State University, Queensland University of Technology, Bentley College, and Worcester Polytechnic Institute that together have many years of experience in teaching with SAP or with the Oracle e-business suite. This paper includes a summary of the experiences at each of these schools, advice based on questions from the audience at an AMCIS 2005 panel, and references to resources that may be helpful to those considering, or already engaged in, teaching with enterprise systems.

%X Environmental management information systems (EMIS) is defined as 'organizational-technical systems for systematically obtaining, processing, and making available relevant environmental information available in companies'.  Such systems evolved out of a growing need to manage environmental information in response to internal and external pressures such as regulations, consumers, stockholders, and changes in the business environments. While over the past decade EMIS have proliferated in the corporate landscape, these systems have received little attention within the information systems research community as whole. The objective of this paper is to serve as a tutorial providing a conceptual overview of EMIS, highlighting organizational and technical issues, as well as research opportunities.  In this paper we suggest that there are significant and relatively untapped research synergies existing between information systems and environmental management for sustainable development at the organizational and technical levels.

%X This study examines information systems (IS) research in Chinese Mainland in recent years and identifies the similarities and the differences between international and Chinese IS research in terms of research topics and research methods. The data consists of a total of 410 research papers published in ten leading Chinese academic journals related to IS over the five-year period from 1999 to 2004. Compared to IS research abroad, the following may be said of Chinese IS research: (1) Systems-related issues, especially system design issues, system implementation, analytical models and tools, DSS/ESS/EIS are emphasized in research topics, whereas human-related and research methodologies issues are scarce. (2) Empirical studies, including case study, survey and experiment, are few and far between. (3) The majority of non-empirical studies focus on applications and conceptual description of IS, mainly in different applied fields and introducing or illustrating hot topics abroad. The "general shift" from traditional issues such as system design to non-technical problems is still continuing. There is a need to go beyond mere description of IS related phenomenon and to move away from non-empirical to empirical studies.

%X The software crisis has been around since 1968 when NATO first identified the problematic nature of software development. In recognition of the need to manage the process of software development many methodologies have been proposed over the years. A recent contribution to this rich set of rigorous software development methodologies is the Software Engineering Institute's (SEI) Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMi) methodology. While the minimal previous research on CMMi has extolled it, learning how to implement CMMi successfully requires leaning also from its failures. And yet, despite apparent anecdotes, little is known on this topic possibly because of the reluctance of many companies to wash their dirty linen in public.  Based on a set of in-depth interviews accompanied with survey verification, this study examines the assessed effectiveness and efficiency of CMMi as implemented in several projects in a large high tech company in which only low levels of CMMi maturity were reached. In an exploratory manner this study shows the need to differentiate between the quality of the software product developed through CMMi and the quality of the process involved. The study also shows that whether the product is an off the shelf product or a customized one has a direct bearing of the quality of the product developed under CMMi methodology and the process itself. In particular, we discuss why some projects reach only a low maturity level of CMMi even though the organization as a whole might typically reach high maturity levels.

%X Looking at prominent centers of software activity across the globe we observe that software developers tell narratives about themselves to explain their identity and their successes. For example, the USA thinks in terms of the cowboy programmer, Ireland the Celtic Tiger, and Israel the commando programmer.  These narratives provide insights into the mental world of individuals and groups in the global software industry.   This paper collects and documents the narratives of software professionals in six nations:  Russia, Israel, Ireland, USA, India, and Brazil.  The country choice reflects a cross-section of prominent software nations.  Using a taxonomy adapted from the political identity literature, we classify these narratives.  The most frequently occurring narrative is the interplay between redemption, national suffering and heroism.  Brazil, Russia, India, and Israel offer distinct narratives of redemption and suffering. Israel and the USA use distinct narratives of valor.  Among the six nations' narratives, we find that some narratives are collectively oriented while others are individualistically oriented.   National narratives are important for reasons both academic and practical. The literature on comparative human capital focuses on readily measurable data.  Therefore, there may be a gap in understanding global competition in software.  Narratives influence important decisions, such as where to locate a new software R&D site or where to invest in start-ups. An understanding of narratives helps to shape them.

%X Clinical decision-making can be improved if healthcare practitioners are able to leverage both the tacit and explicit modalities of healthcare knowledge, yet at present there do not exist knowledge management systems that support any active and direct mapping between these two knowledge modalities. In this paper, we present a healthcare knowledge-mapping framework that maps (a) the tacit knowledge captured in terms of email-based discussions between pediatric pain practitioners through a Pediatric Pain Mailing List (PPML), to (b) explicit knowledge represented in terms of peer-reviewed healthcare literature available at PubMed. We report our knowledge mapping strategy that involves methods to establish discussion threads, organize the discussion threads in terms of topic-specific taxonomy, formulate an optimal search query based on the content of a discussion thread, submit the search query to PubMed and finally to retrieve and present the search results to the user.

%X This study examines the impact of handheld computers on students in a first year Information Technology course (IT101), measuring IT attitudes, skills, and performance. Students in standard sections used their laptop computers and traditional textbooks. Students in intensive sections used both handheld computers and laptop computers, that is, multiple platforms. Both standard and intensive sections covered the same topics. Although students in both standard and intensive sections became more skilled during the semester, students in the intensive sections improved more in programming and Microsoft Excel skills. Students in intensive sections also scored significantly better than students in the standard sections on the common portion of the final exam. Finally, according to anecdotal evidence, students in the intensive sections gained significantly more skill-based confidence in IT unrelated to handheld computers compared to students in the standard sections. Seven of our ten expectations were supported. While students benefited from the intensive version of IT101, several factors could account for the improvements: a self-selection factor, an active learning vs. textbook learning factor, and possibly an instructor factor. Future research should shed light on the relative weights of these factors.

%X With the emergence of free and open source software (F/OSS) projects (e.g. Linux) as serious contenders to well-established proprietary software, advocates of F/OSS are quick to generalize the superiority of this approach to software development.  On the other hand, some well-established software development firms view F/OSS as a threat and vociferously refute the claims of F/OSS advocates. This article represents a tutorial on F/OSS that tries objectively to identify and present open source software's concepts, benefits, and challenges.  From our point of view, F/OSS is more than just software. We conceptualize it as an IPO system that consists of the license as the boundary of the system, the community that provides the input, the development process, and the software as the output.  After describing the evolution and definition of F/OSS, we identify three approaches to benefiting from F/OSS that center on (1) the software, (2) the community, and (3) the license respectively. Each approach is fit for a specific situation and provides a unique set of benefits and challenges. We further illustrate our points by refuting common misconceptions associated with F/OSS based upon our conceptual framework.

%X IT organizations face many new challenges. While strong IT leaders are needed, few IT leadership teams as yet are well-equipped for the job. Very practical reasons imply that all IT staff should now be expected to act as leaders, regardless of their official job title: a new top line focus; the growing impact of IT decisions on organizations; and the complexity of the work to be done. These requirements are driving the need to push leadership skills and competencies further down in the IT organization. This paper explores how organizations are addressing these new requirements for leadership in IT. It examines the qualities that make a good IT leader and what companies are doing to build better leaders at all levels of their organizations. It concludes by outlining a value proposition for investing in IT leadership development.

%X Information systems analysis and design are basic topics in the Information Systems (IS) curriculum. A large number of IS graduates are employed as information systems developers.  However, research in the IS field pays relatively little attention to IS analysis and design topics.  Few of the articles published in leading IS research journals in the last decade deal with these topics In response, CAIS and JAIS are jointly presenting Special Themes on Research in Information Systems Analysis and Design to begin to fill this void and to attract attention of researchers to this important area.

%X Organizations analyze their business processes in order to improve them. Business processes are also considered retainers, users and creators of organizational knowledge. Thus, they can be analyzed to identify the knowledge used, created and embedded in them. A process analysis approach that focuses on redesign does not necessarily capture the knowledge used and created in a process. Choosing a knowledge-focused approach should lead to understanding knowledge needs but might not lead to improved business processes. This paper describes an approach for Knowledge Requirements Analysis (KRA) that combines process analysis with identifying knowledge used and created during the process. KRA is the process of identifying and analyzing existing organizational knowledge and prescribing improvements to it. The KRA methodology presented in this paper combines two methods: a knowledge engineering method (CommonKADS) and a process modeling method (EDPDT). The EDPDT constructs are used to operationalize the organization and task models of CommonKADS and thus create the KRA methodology. The methodology was applied successfully to the process of ethical reviews of grant applications in a university. The main advantage of the proposed methodology is that it enables organizations to keep track of their knowledge resources embedded in various business processes. Knowledge that is not shared or used can be detected and new knowledge can be identified to support and improve existing processes better. This approach can lead to improved knowledge management in organizations

%X The evaluation of information systems development methodologies is becoming increasingly important. Some researchers propose their own criteria for conceptual evaluations. But such criteria are often constrained by the limitation of the researcher's view toward and experience with development methodologies. Furthermore, existing evaluation criteria are either not practical for direct measurement or not tested for validity and reliability. The lack of a generally acceptable, practically valid, and reliable set of criteria for evaluation hinders the development of knowledge in this area. Our study is a step toward developing a systematic process to evaluate information systems development methodologies. We captured the opinions of a group of twenty-eight researchers and practitioners who are experienced in information systems development methodologies. Through a systematic content analysis, the authors classified these criteria into three categories:  (1) methodology design, (2) methodology use, and (3) methodology deliverables. The three categories of criteria are not totally separate in that they represent the means and goals of information systems development methodologies. Appropriate criteria should be applied depending on the stages when evaluation is performed.

For people further along in their careers, participation includes the leading roles of program chair, track chair, and associate editor. Key administrative roles such as organizing chair, publicity chair, and secretary are also described. Without these roles being fulfilled enthusiastically and effectively, conferences cannot be successful and the discipline is thereby impoverished.

%X The quality of research published in journals is not only dependent on the work performed by authors, but also on the service undertaken by peer reviewers. In this paper, we take a two-pronged qualitative approach to establish an integrated set of criteria for reviewers, for the reviews they produce, and for the papers they review in the IS domain. These criteria are intended to be of value to three sets of stakeholders: authors, reviewers and editors. Authors should find them useful as they write, knowing in advance how reviewers are evaluating their work; reviewers should find them useful to improve the quality of the reviews of manuscripts; editors should use them to ensure that manuscripts are well written and that reviewers performed their tasks effectively. We discuss the implications of these criteria for the review process and identify areas for future research.

%X This article presents a broad view of systems analysis and design (SA&D) research. Although SA&D is a critical area of research in the information systems field, relatively little such research has been published in leading IS journals.  To point toward increased research opportunities for SA&D work, this article presents a framework that illustrates the broad range of activities within the SA&D area.  This framework contrasts with narrower views that consider SA&D to be concerned primarily with software development.  The framework positions SA&D activities in a two-dimensional space.  We identify theoretical and practical research issues that apply across the full range of SA&D activities as well as issues that apply to specific situations.  Research opportunities in SA&D are described and discussed.

%X It is customary for the outgoing President of AIS to publish a report in CAIS on the activities during his or her tenure  and on future directions for the organization. This is such a report.   On becoming President I was fortunate in findinbg an organization in good shape thanks to the excellent work of my predecessors. Consequently, AIS faced no immediate crises and it was possible to focus on some longer term issues such attaining global reach for the organization, increasing member involvement, transparency, and the state of the discipline. One crisiss that did arise concerned AACSB curriculum standards; this crisis was successfully solved thanks to the rapid and dedicated reaction of a number of members.  The longer term issues mentioned, together with the need to constantly enhance service to members, will probably continue to occupy the AIS leadership.

%X A free learning portal designed to help faculty to teach, learn, and connect with others in the fields of data warehousing, DSS/BI, and database is being made available by Teradata, a division of NCR. Teradata worked closely with  leading academics to create the Teradata University Network (www.teradatauniversitynetwork.com).  The network is reached by faculty through a portal that includes (1) course syllabi; (2) access to software; (2) Power Point presentations (with speaker's notes); (4) cases, projects, and assignments (with teaching notes); (5) book chapters, articles, and research reports; (6) the Teradata library; (7) web-based courses; and (8) links to related sites.   In addition, a separate portal for students, located at www.teradatastudentnetwork.com, leads to a subset of the above materials, including (1) access to software; (2) cases, projects, and assignments (without teaching notes); (3) book chapters, articles, and research reports; (4) the Teradata library; and (5) links to related sites.  The student site excludes materials that are only for course instructors.  This tutorial describes the creation of the Teradata University Network (TUN), discusses how faculty access and use TUN, describes how a faculty member might use it in a typical session, and faculty reactions to TUN.  Special attention is given to the software available on TUN and TSN. It also discusses working with Teradata and TUN and provides lessons learned to help other faculty involved in vendor-supported initiatives.

%X Disaster recovery planning for organizations is fundamental and often urgent.  Planning supports the firm's ability to recover the core business functionality of its software, data,  and systems after the occurrence of a natural or man-made disaster. Organizations must take steps to protect their software, systems and data backups from natural disasters, power outages, and even terrorist attacks. However the issue of disaster recovery is often awash in checklists or marooned in mundane statistics. Such sterile approaches tend to lead key managers, CEOs, and CIOs to relegate disaster recovery planning to a lower priority when they become overwhelmed with planning minutiae or bored with staid presentations. This paper introduces a theatre metaphor to enable a lively discussion and deeper understanding of disaster recovery planning. Specifically, we introduce the concept of workshopping a play. We explore this new approach from the world of theatrical productions to illuminate and deepen understanding of the importance of testing, evaluation, and reworking of scenarios for each potential disaster.

%X The authors convened a focus group of senior IT managers from a number of leading edge organizations to explore the topic of digital dashboards - defined as "electronic interfaces (typically portals) that provide employees with timely, personalized information to enable them to monitor and analyze the performance of the organization". Whereas earlier executive-based systems were not only "hand-tooled" exclusively for executives, they were also designed for (and based on the anticipation of) executives performing "what-if" analyses. In contrast, today's digital dashboards appear to be much more focused on providing information (i.e., access) and much less focused on supporting the analysis of the information provided. While this difference appears nuanced, it represents a profound difference in terms of the how the management function is supported by information technology. An analysis of the focus group's dashboards found three different categories: performance-based to display the basic mix of financial and non-financial results broken out by current versus previous period, actual versus target, project-based which relate primarily to status reporting where the only comparative data is "actual to budget", and opportunity-based where the goal is to guide employees towards new opportunities for enhancing the business. While each category is for an express purpose, it is possible to group the benefits of all dashboards into the following four categories: alignment with strategy and accountabilities, enhanced decision making support and analysis, improved integrity and timeliness of data, and operational efficiencies. Furthermore, these benefits are no longer only for the senior executives. The availability of digital dashboards changed Executive Information Systems so that they are everyone's information system. The paper concludes with suggested strategies for implementing digital dashboards successfully to reap these benefits.

%X Mobile communication technologies are changing every aspect of the daily life, bringing new opportunities in many areas. Several converging mobile systems can potentially change organizations significantly by shifting the traditional boundaries of work-life and the workplace. Mobile telephony, combining satellite and terrestrial cellular systems, already transformed the way people work by allowing 'anytime/anywhere' telephone calling and text messaging. Broadband mobile telephony opens additional avenues to provide information conveniently as quickly and easily as possible, when needed and where needed. The evolution of wireless technologies (from Wireless Personal Area Networks to ubiquitous Third Generation/Universal Mobile Telecommunication System - UMTS) increased the number of services available to business organizations and mobile workers. Machine-to-machine, vertical applications, and mobile office applications are increasingly being deployed. Service providers and mobile operators are also changing the way they operate as a result of the increasing availability of mobile broadband communication services. IT departments need to change their systems, upgrade, and adapt their infrastructure and policies to support these mobile services. These changes are both positive and negative. With this progression, some fundamental questions related to privacy, security, and a new concept of work place and work space are raised. The implications for developing economies, such as China, and their potential for leapfrogging are future attention areas.

%X Computer-based information systems in general, and Internet e-commerce and e-business systems in particular, employ many types of resources that need to be protected against access by unauthorized users. Three main components of access control are used in most information systems: identification, authentication, and authorization. In this paper we focus on authentication, which is the most problematic component. The three main approaches to user authentication are: knowledge-based, possession-based, and biometric-based. We review and compare the various authentication mechanisms of these approaches and the technology and implementation issues they involve. Our conclusion is that there is no silver bullet solution to user authentication problems. Authentication practices need improvement.  Further research should lead to a better understanding of user behavior and the applied psychology aspects of computer security.

%X This research builds Internet growth forecasting models based on existing knowledge of diffusion and connectionist theories.  It shows that a simple connectionist multi-layered perceptron artificial neural network (MLP) model can create a flexible response function to forecast Internet growth for the near future.  This paper identifies the most suitable diffusion models that generate predictions for the Internet diffusion with low errors.  However, the MLP model is superior to the best diffusion model on both the calibration and the validation samples of Internet growth data.  This research also investigates the process of combining diffusion and connectionist models.  The findings will encourage researchers to use connectionist models to predict diffusion of other innovation processes also.

This paper evaluates the literature and provides current information for IS researchers and instructors focusing on electronic commerce. In this paper, we explore the components of e-credit providers (conventional, person-to-person, and third-party) and explain how each system processes a single transaction. We then analyze several market leaders in each segment and summarize the strengths and weaknesses of each company. We provide guidelines for selecting an e-credit provider and highlight the options that apply best to online businesses. Finally, we outline potential areas of future research and provide a simple tutorial on creating a business account with PayPal website Payments Standard as an example of an online payment provider.

%X High levels of investments in IT and related products and services by firms over the last several decades produced only mixed results.  Research shows that one of the most significant determinants of successful IT investments is the alignment between IT and the competitive strategies of a firm.  Yet it is largely unclear to both researchers and practitioners how to achieve such alignment in the complex business environment.  In this paper, we present and analyze the findings from a case study on how one company uses a well-established strategic management tool, the balanced scorecard, as the framework for aligning its IT initiatives with business strategies. The result is a forward-looking, strategy-oriented corporate culture and financial success for the company.  Based on our findings, we expand the Reich and Benbasat alignment model by adding relationship management as an antecedent of alignment and balanced scorecard as a tool for achieving, managing, and sustaining such alignment.  Managerial and research implications are discussed, as are directions for future research.

%X Numerous studies of global electronic government adoption use the presence or absence of website functions to measure development levels and create rankings. This paper investigates whether these ratings really reflect the overall status of e-government by using a case study of the 89 regional governments in Russia. It provides the results of two waves of evaluating these websites using measures derived from prior e-government studies. These website levels are correlated to available data reflecting the status of e-government in many of these regions. It is concluded that website levels are only loosely coupled to the overall state of e-government in these regions. It is therefore hazardous to draw too many conclusions about the development of e-government in various countries using relative rankings that are only based on websites. As a case study, this paper illustrates what can and cannot be done when highly limited data are available.

%X User acceptance issues and user-centered design have long been an important theme in information systems research. In the field of health care information systems, much attention has been devoted to user issues in the health care provider domain, e.g. physicians, nurses, medical records. Recent developments toward promoting more consumer-oriented healthcare information systems have opened new questions about how individuals can and should relate to their personal health information in the form of Personal Health Records (PHR) systems. This paper adopts a user-driven perspective toward these new and challenging questions. Drawing upon ideas and discussions from a cross-section of information systems researchers, health care providers, private industry, and government, we examine several of the major issues that will need to be addressed in order to meet a national challenge to adopt PHR for all Americans by 2014.

%X The use of research models in driving scholarly investigation is of great importance in any field, including information systems (IS).  As such, a taxonomy of IS research models should be of substantial value to the discipline.  Such a taxonomy is developed in this article based on the IS research literature.  Eleven model types are examined in detail in order to investigate how they are used by researchers, in articles published in seven leading IS journals during a recent six year period.  Interesting results emerge in the use of models overall, as well as trends over time and relationships with specific methodologies and IS journals.  Multi-tier influence diagram is the most used research model in IS research, while the no model, listing of variables, mathematical model, and simple influence diagram also find significant usage among the IS research community.  Patterns of model use were also identified based on top journals and prevalent research methodologies.

Eighty official regional governmental websites in 2003 and 85 in 2004 are examined to benchmark their contents according to a set of measures related to Information, Communications / Participation, Action / Transaction, and Integration.  This paper also considers the contributions of the Electronic Russia (E-Russia) program launched in 2002 as a nine-year, $2.57B effort to bring e-government to Russia. It is concluded that the main thrust of the websites was on the Information category, with some increases in the Communications / Participation from 2003 to 2004. Almost no services were enacted. Using a detailed analysis of the E-Russia expenditures, it is concluded that this program was focused more on building infrastructure than on building up e-government websites or increasing Internet access. Most support is found for the proposition that Russian e-government efforts so far have done little to enhance the preconditions for democracy, but at the same time should not be viewed as a "Potemkin village," i.e. as a means to conceal moves away from democracy.

%X This teaching case features a situation at Belgacom, the leading telecommunications company in Belgium, end of April 2005. Wim Bouckenooghe, newly appointed finance director of Belgacom's Network and IT division within the Fixed Line Services (FLS) segment, is troubled by the effectiveness of the selection of the discretionary IT projects, particularly the larger ones. He is especially concerned about the early stages of developing ideas into project proposals and the prioritization of these proposals for selection for development into full, detailed business cases. Bouckenooghe is keen to raise his doubts and propose improvements at the next quarterly meeting of the FLS management committee in July. The teaching case is designed to enable a multifaceted class discussion on the principles, tools, and practices of IT project selection, with a special focus on the early assessment and funneling of project ideas.

%X Although the value of Information Technology (IT) certifications has been widely debated in the IT industry, academia has largely ignored the issue. This study intends to bridge such a gap.  Anchored on human capital theory and previous literature, we build a comprehensive model to estimate the value of various IT certifications in terms of their contributions to IT professionals' wages.  We estimate our model using third-party survey data.  The three main findings from the study are: 1) IT certifications are valuable in general; 2) there is a substitution effect between IT certifications and education and between IT certifications and experience; and 3) the value of IT certifications are job and industry specific. In addition, we estimate wage premiums of various IT certifications in the study.  From these findings, we draw managerial implications for current and future IT professionals, IT managers, and human resource managers.

%X Defining the central identity of the information systems (IS) field is a subject of ongoing concern and debate among IS researchers. Published empirical studies to date have focused on restricted sets of IS-related journal publications spread across relatively short time periods. This paper offers a broader review of the central identity of the IS field, using three dimensions proposed by Albert and Whetten [1985]: central character (i.e., what topics do IS scholars research?); temporal continuity (i.e., to what extent has the identity of the IS field remained static over time?); and distinctiveness (i.e., how unique is research published in IS vs. non-IS research journals?). The first two dimensions are examined using a dataset containing 6,466 journal citations drawn from seven leading IS journals over a 32-year period, and the third is evaluated by comparing results from these seven journals with research published in 15 leading non-IS business journals over the same time period. Results suggest that articles published in leading IS journals do share a strong central character that is distinct from research published in non-IS journals, and yet an identity that has continually shifted over time. This study contributes to the literature by providing an empirically supported review of who we are, how we are different, and some thoughts about where we may be going as a discipline.

%X Healthcare processes are frequently fragmented and often badly supported with IT. Inter- and intra-organizational communication and media frictions complicate the continuous provision of information according to the principle of information logistics. Based on extensive literature review, we present the vision of seamless healthcare with horizontally and vertically integrated healthcare processes enabled by seamless IT support. Its implementation requires the establishment of a communication infrastructure and the deployment of adequate standards in healthcare. There are already comprehensive approaches for dealing with integrating heterogeneous information systems. However, they lack a common communication infrastructure and do not support proactivity and flexibility which are dominant characteristics in healthcare. We propose a software agent-based approach for realizing the vision of seamless healthcare. We present a corresponding implementation for integrating heterogeneous information systems in the context of the German Health Telematics Infrastructure. Based on the concept and the implementation, we show that the modular approach is capable of supporting a wide range of different applications. We furthermore outline which facets of an agent-based solution could be implemented in an operative real-world environment. In closing we derive implications for IT decision makers in healthcare and show directions for future approaches for reducing information logistics related deficits in healthcare.

%X Despite a steadily growing industry of third party providers, IT organizations to date have ventured rather cautiously into this new area of IT function delivery. This paper attempts to explain why this is so by examining the decision behavior and practices of a number of leading edge organizations. From this analysis, four key decision criteria were identified: flexibility, control, knowledge enhancement and business exigency. Based on the insights of the focus group, the concept of a maturity model for IT functions is introduced as well as a function delivery profile to map delivery options onto core and non-core IT functions. We argue that these elements should form the basis of a decision framework to guide the selection of delivery options. Following this framework, organizations should now begin to move beyond the exploration stage to develop more strategic, nuanced and methodological approaches to IT function delivery.

%X The decline in new entrants to IT professions coincides with the burgeoning use of new information and communications technologies among adolescent users. Teenage girls embrace a wide range of new technologies, yet are less interested in IT-related careers or college majors than their counterparts in earlier years. In order to forestall further declines in IT college majors, educators in middle schools and high schools must learn how to better instill an appreciation for IT career opportunities in their students. The purpose of this paper is to report on our descriptive study of teenagers’ technology-based perceptions, habits and interests, and to explore the link between these usage patterns and other personal attributes concerning technology access in their homes and schools. Analysis of more than 300 surveys reveals both similarities and differences in male and female elective technology use. Of particular note is that many of the gender-related differences do not appear until high school. This signals that students must be made aware of the importance and benefits of computing technology for purposes other than leisure or social interaction in the lower grades, and also in the home. We also find significant differences in gender-based usage patterns and perspectives on computing. With this understanding of current usage patterns, educators and employers will be in a better position to review IT-related pedagogy and curricula, and to appraise IT career options in a more informed light.

%X Churchman [1971] defines inquiry as an activity that produces knowledge.  He examines the epistemologies of five schools of philosophy from the perspective of general systems theory, asking the question as to whether each is suitable as the basis for the design of computer-based "inquiring systems."  He considers systems design and design theory in some detail.  We believe that Churchman's inquiring systems can form the basis for the design of knowledge management systems and that the IS research community has hardly tapped the potential of inquiring systems in that regard.  Mason and Mitroff [1973] brought inquiring systems into the IS literature early on, essentially making the work endogenous to the field.  We argue that building on inquiring systems can contribute to developing IS as a discipline by maintaining continuity in research and developing a theory that IS can call its own.  We believe that the lack of use of Churchman's work may be due to its lack of visibility in recent years and attempt to remedy that by summarizing the basics of the inquirers in some detail, trying not to interpret, but to remain faithful to the original. The paper encourages readers to study the original and develop their own notion of how the inquirers might be used in knowledgemanagement work.  There are probably as many different perspectives on how inquiring systems could support KMS as there are IS researchers willing to study them.  We would like to encourage a proliferation of such perspectives.

%X This paper reports a descriptive case study of the IS academic discipline in Australia. One in a series of nine papers comprising a special issue of Communications of the AIS (CAIS) titled "The Information Systems Academic Discipline in Pacific Asia," this sub-study sought to establish the "beginnings" of a cumulative and ongoing effort to track and report on, and reflect upon the evolution and state of the IS academic discipline in Australia (and Pacific Asia and ultimately other world regions). This paper clarifies the role of the Australian study as a preliminary to the larger Pacific Asia study, and draws upon a series of case studies of Australian states and territories to present the Australian situation. The case study protocol, based in Ridley's [2006] framework on the evolution of disciplines, suggests an inverse relationship between the impact of local contingencies and a discipline's degree of professionalism and maturity. Analysis of Australian data reveals considerable diversity in IS research and teaching across the nation, reflecting the wide geographic spread of universities in Australia. Although in general IS research is not highly contingent upon local exigencies and environmental pressures, the topics researched often reflected personal interests and are only weakly coordinated across research sites. At this time IS in Australia does not possess a unique symbol system that allows unambiguous communication between initiates within the field.

%X This paper examines the background and development of academic information systems as a field of teaching and research in universities in New Zealand, from its roots in the late 1970s until the present time. Interviews were held with key informants within the information systems departments in every university in the country, as well as one polytechnic institution which has recently applied for university status.  Based on the interview data along with other data drawn from the universities' Web sites and elsewhere, as well as the personal knowledge of the authors, individual case studies of each institution were prepared and validated by the key informants.  The paper begins with an overview analysis of the current situation and recent past, with a special emphasis on the student enrolment issue.  The information systems discipline is reviewed across the nine institutions through a detailed cross-case analysis including a number of summary tables comparing various statistics across all New Zealand institutions.  The cross-case analysis addresses issues such as the role of international students in IS, the comparative location of IS in the various institutions, and the overall "nature" of IS across the country.  The results of this study and analysis provide a unique perspective on the past, present, and future of academic information systems in New Zealand.

The analysis provides a useful basis for decision makers to exploit opportunities and minimize external threats. The study also offers useful insights for Information Systems academics contemplating administrative relocation of their group. The paper serves the dual-purpose of (1) informing the positioning of IS in the four case institutions, while (2) evolving an approach and related tools for usefully extending the SWOT analysis to other institutions and states, and across time. The extension of the analysis to other states and to IS groups in differing circumstances will broaden the relevance of study findings, while improving our understanding of differential placement of IS and perceptions of the relative advantages of the alternatives.

%X Many innovative wireless applications that aim to provide mobile information access are emerging. Since people have different information needs and preferences, one of the challenges for mobile information systems is to take advantage of the convenience of handheld devices and provide personalized information to the right person in a preferred format. However, the unique features of wireless networks and mobile devices pose challenges to personalized mobile content delivery. This paper proposes a generic framework for delivering personalized and adaptive content to mobile users. It introduces a variety of enabling technologies and highlights important issues in this area. The framework can be applied to many applications such as mobile commerce and context-aware mobile services.

%X Web engineering is the process used to create high-quality Web-based systems and applications that deliver a complex array of content and functionality to a broad population of end-users. As Web Engineering continues to grow in popularity with practitioners and academics alike, so far, there hasn't been any assessment of its accumulated body of knowledge in terms of academic research.  Because Web engineering was established as a new discipline some five years ago, it is perhaps time to take stock of the efforts made in this field. Using the Web Engineering Process Model developed by Pressman, this paper organizes and map progress made so far. The results suggest a significant need for theory-based research in Web Engineering. The paper discusses some of the managerial and research implications of the findings.

%X Hypermedia systems development is, in many regards, different from "conventional" systems development, chief amongst these differences being its multidisciplinary nature. Foremost amongst the roles in hypermedia development are software engineering and graphic design. However, traditionally the tension between software engineers and graphic designers is pronounced.  It is therefore  important to gain an understanding of the differences between the two camps with a view to bringing them closer together. This paper reports on the findings of a survey of hypermedia developers conducted in Ireland.  One of the objectives of the survey was to compare and contrast the development approaches, methods, and techniques used by software engineers with those used by graphic designers. It was found that software engineers and graphic designers are much closer than might be believed in their attitudes on the value and importance of processes and documented working methods. However, graphic designers primarily base development approaches around the use of specific tools, whereas software engineers are more reliant on traditional and object-oriented software development methods. Regarding diagramming methods, there is some evidence of cross-pollination, as software engineers often use informal techniques such as storyboarding and graphic designers use software engineering techniques such as use case diagrams, but graphic designers find software engineering techniques to be less useful than vice versa.

%X IS researchers may wonder why computing advances often confound expectations. The leisure society, the paperless office, and programmer decline are just a few predictions that didn't happen. If current expectations are to be any more accurate, we must learn from experience. As we create e-systems to rival ourselves, and networks to match society, the problem may be a limited view of system performance. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) sees performance as functionality plus usability. The Web Of System Performance (WOSP) model presented in this paper extends TAM to include other requirements common in performance research literature. WOSP is a theoretical framework for the balanced design and evaluation of advanced information systems, as now being created on the Internet and elsewhere. It analyses performance via four fundamental system elements: boundary, internal structure, effectors and receptors. Each can be designed for opportunity or risk, giving eight performance goals, whose design tension comprises a "web" of performance. It explains why advances sometimes "bite back", and need creative system requirements integration. The theory applies to hardware, software, cognitive, or social system levels, but as each level is a different "world", it cannot be instantiated across levels. The WOSP model should  interest those designing or evaluating advanced software systems.

These images, particularly those relating to participative and adaptive development, will be used to propose parallel emergent forms of computer-based information systems development practices and disciplinary relationships that have the potential to address the inconsistent performance of information systems and a record that includes some notable failures. As well as providing guidance to the IS profession and practice, the paper discusses implications for our teaching and the discipline of information systems in general.

%X Recent conversations with IT managers suggest that IT professionalism is a growing problem for them and for their organizations.  Managers are frustrated that many of their newer employees simply don't understand what it means to "be professional" in their job.  Neither schools nor companies teach professionalism.  Instead, it remains an unarticulated set of working behaviors, attitudes, and expectations.  Yet IT professionalism has never been more important.  Teamwork - with users, vendors, consultants and business partners - is the name of the game today, and with it comes an increased dependence on and interaction with others.  Today, IT workers are being held accountable to this new, unwritten set of standards that governs not only their work and how they, themselves, are perceived, but also how the whole of IT is perceived by the rest of the organization and others outside it. This paper provides a composite picture of IT professionalism and how to develop it.

%X In an important ISR research commentary, Orlikowski and Iacono [2001] argue that the IS field does not deeply engage in its core subject matter, "the IT artifact." Although agreeing with their analysis and their conclusions concerning the unfortunate lack of engagement with the IT artifact, this article questions their premise that the IT artifact should be viewed as the core of the IS field. After defining the term "work system" and summarizing previously published frameworks for understanding a work system in operation and a work system life cycle, this article presents 18 reasons why IT-reliant work systems should replace "the IT artifact" as the core of the IS field. Taken in combination, the 18 reasons express a belief that today's IS field is inherently work system-centric, rather than IT-centric even though IT artifacts are present wherever the IS discipline is genuinely relevant. The specific reasons involve important topics including IS success, IS costs, IS risks, IS life cycles, methods for analyzing systems, communication with business professionals, organizing and codifying knowledge about systems in organizations, and maximizing the value of IS research.

%X Concept maps, a specific kind of mental model, are one method of representing and measuring an individual's knowledge.  They are an alternative tool for teaching through building relevant associations, and a method for measuring knowledge and recall over time.  Concept maps provide a visual representation of conceptual and relationship knowledge within a particular domain.  Concept maps look like a spider web, consisting of many nodes (i.e., key concepts) connected to one another by lines that indicate relationships.  In the learning process, students can develop concept maps as an alternative to traditional note-taking by building associations of non-linear key concepts and organizing them to fit with their individual learning styles and frames of reference.  The presence of concepts and relationships on a map can provide an instructor with a snapshot of student knowledge and understanding.  The proximity and connection of key concepts provide insight for instructors attempting to evaluate how ideas from class were absorbed by students.  Conversely, the absence of concepts or relationships, or inappropriate connections between unrelated concepts, provide clues about what information students failed to internalize or incorporate.  Concept maps may aid the instructor in assessing what students understand and how they relate the material to the overall course goals.  They are easily taught and can be incorporated in introductory units, mid-term reviews and assessments, or end-of-course reviews and assessments.

%X This paper presents a systematic procedure to elicit and aggregate the knowledge of multiple individual experts and represent it in the form of an Aggregated Causal Map (ACM). This procedure differs from existing methods in two ways. First, unlike other methods, this method does not rely on group interaction in eliciting knowledge of multiple experts, and, therefore, is not fraught with biases associated with group dynamics. Second, this method uses both the idiographic and nomothetic approaches while existing methods focus on nomothetic approaches to knowledge elicitation. We draw on the strengths of both approaches by using the idiographic approach to elicit and aggregate the knowledge of multiple experts and the nomothetic approach to validate the knowledge elicited. We illustrate the procedure by constructing the ACM of eight key decision makers about an enterprise system adoption decision.

%X The "IT artifact" and debates about the core of the IS field received a lot of attention in the last several years. This paper is a response to Benbasat and Zmud's June 2003 MISQ paper "The Identity Crisis within the IS Discipline: Defining and Communicating the Discipline's Core Properties," which argues that "the IT artifact and its immediate nomological net" constitutes "a natural ensemble of entities, structures, and processes" that "serves to bind together the IS subdisciplines and to communicate the distinctive nature of the IS discipline." This paper starts by examining the meaning of "IT artifact" and concluding that this term is too unclear to serve as a basic concept for delineating the field. Next it examines and disputes aspects of Benbasat and Zmud's prescription for being more faithful to the discipline's core. It suggests that their vision of tighter focus on variables intimately related to the "IT artifact" creates problems and provides few of the benefits of an alternative vision centered on "systems in organizations." This alternative vision provides an understandable umbrella for most existing IS research and treats the discipline's diversity as a strength rather a weakness. It provides a rationale for building on current knowledge and expertise, exploiting the discipline's areas of competitive advantage in academia and business, defusing the IS discipline's identity crisis, and helping increase its long-term contributions to academia, business, and society.

The history and scope of investments in computing, and the practices of software engineering demonstrate that we are not a New Collective  suffering from an identity crisis. We are a heterogeneous group looking at a wide diversity of Information Systems, some of which challenge the way we think about organizational boundaries and show that artifacts are not adequate to define IT.

%X Even though computerized information systems are a relatively recent phenomenon that continues to evolve, these technology-based systems are now studied by a maturing academic discipline.  This article examines the issue of Information Systems (IS) core concepts; explores the content and boundaries of the Information Systems research domain; and discusses whether consensus about an identity and domain for Information Systems is important and worth discussing. Despite concerns in the profession about an IS identity crisis, Information Systems is a legitimate area of scientific research and inquiry. Groups like the Association for Information Systems are institutionalizing the IS domain of inquiry. Furthermore, Information Systems researchers are becoming much more assertive about the importance of the IS research domain.

%X Historically, the IS community found little difficulty in producing rigorous research, but its relevance for the practitioner community is frequently questioned.  While agreeing with the need for a sharper focus for IS research, this paper suggests that past problems with relevance can be avoided by engaging the academic and practitioner communities in setting a research agenda using an "open source" approach.  Such an approach would assure that academic researchers remain focused on relevant issues in a fast-moving field, and offers an opportunity to draw the academic and practitioner communities closer together for their mutual benefit.

%X Information Systems and other academic fileds struggle with what is termed an identity crisis. For Information Systems, an ongoing debate focuses on defining the field narrowly versus broadly. Defining the field narrowly, as called for by Benbesat and Zmud's nomological core [2003] is compelling because it distinctly defines what is IS research and what is not. Those who find the distinctness of IS lacking may find this a pragmatic solution. However, the narrow definition excludes a large portion of the IS community and their research. Alter's [2003] Systems in Organizations proposal broadly defines the IS discipline in an inclusive way that embraces our historic diversity and makes IS distinct too.

%X In one of the recent additions to the IS identity and diversity discussion, Alter  questions the definition and relevance of "IT artifact" as defined by Benbasat and Zmud.  In terms of definition, we believe that there is no substantial difference between Alter's work system construct and IT artifact.  However, when it comes to enhancing the relevance of and guiding the diversity in IT research, Alter's boundary based approach may be less powerful than a core, IT-artifact based approach.  Alter's focus on systems, nonetheless, has it merits and therefore we suggest a possible convergence of Alter and Benbasat and Zmud's constructs.

%X The paper argues that we should emphasize more the nature of Information Systems as an applied, engineering-like discipline that develops various "meta-artifacts" to support the development of IS artifacts. Building such meta-artifacts is a complementary approach to the "theory-with-practical-implications" type of research. The primacy assigned to theory and research method has effectively excluded constructive research of building meta-artifacts from the major IS journals. The paper also claims that information systems as a category of IT artifacts, and especially the focus on IS development, can help to distinguish the IS discipline from its sister and reference disciplines.

%X I believe that a lively and vigorous debate about the nature of the IS discipline is important. We need an open and constructive debate about the identity of the IS field and its subject matter. For this reason I welcome Benbasat and Zmud's June 2003 article in MIS Quarterly in which they suggested that the core of IS research should be the IT artifact. I also welcome Alter's response in this issue of Communications of the AIS, in which he argues that the core of IS research should be "systems in organizations". However, both articles take one point for granted: that the IS discipline is ready and able to define a core. In this article I take issue with this fundamental assumption. I believe the attempt to narrow the field to a core is misguided, at least at this point in time. The argument of this paper is that the field of information systems is nowhere near ready to define a core in information systems.

%X While in theory what an organization knows is fundamental to its success, in practice only a few companies have seen significant business results from their knowledge management (KM) initiatives. Therefore, many knowledge managers are rethinking how and where knowledge really adds value. Connecting knowledge activities to core business processes is slowly coming to be recognized as a second, and more effective, stage of KM in organizations. This paper examines how practicing knowledge managers from several different organizations are knowledge-enabling business processes to deliver business value. It then integrates their experiences with previous research to present a preliminary framework of how to link KM better into business process design activities.

%X The significance of aligning IT with corporate strategy is widely recognized, but the lack of appropriate methodologies prevented practitioners from integrating IT projects with competitive strategies effectively.  This article addresses the issue of deploying Web services strategically using the concept of a widely accepted management tool, the balanced scorecard.  A framework is developed to match potential benefits of Web services with corporate strategy in four business dimensions: innovation and learning, internal business process, customer, and financial.   It is argued that the strategic benefits of implementing Web services can only be realized if the Web services initiatives are planned and implemented within the framework of an IT strategy that is designed to support the business strategy of a firm.

%X Coors Brewing Company is the third largest company in the highly competitive U.S. beer industry. The primary target market for its products is young adults, who demand innovative approaches to marketing from brewers, including relevant and creative point of sale (POS) materials in retail outlets. Coors depends upon the cooperation of distributors and retailers to place Coors' POS materials in ways that will give their products greater visibility. Since all retailers and most distributors of Coors products also sell competitors' products, Coors realized that it must win the battle for mindshare with its distributors and retailers who are in a position to influence what the retail customer buys. For many years, Coors was at a competitive disadvantage with its POS deployment process. The distribution of POS materials was costly and time-consuming, involving paper-based procedures for ordering and fulfillment. In 2001, Coors created an e-Business Department to address enterprise-wide opportunities such as the POS process. As one of their first efforts, members of the e-Business Department created a portal-based POS Application Suite that proved to be highly effective in addressing the needs of its distributors and retailers for POS materials in support of Coors marketing campaigns. As one element of the POS Application Suite, Coors partnered with HP to create an "e-POS system". The e-POS system contains embedded innovative technology that permits distributors to customize POS materials for their specific needs while, at the same time, letting Coors maintain central control over what is permitted to be used under an important new national licensing agreement with the National Football League. The POS Application Suite gives Coors a first-mover advantage over its larger competitors.

An even smaller fraction of these studies focus on small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), which account for a high percent of the economy generated in developing countries.  In this study, managers/owners of SMEs in Chile identified variables that differentiate between adopters and non-adopters of e-commerce. The analysis suggests that Chilean managers/owners most receptive to adopting e-commerce possess the financial and technological resources to implement it, see e-commerce as increasing managerial productivity and supporting strategic decisions, feel external pressure to put e-commerce into operation, perceive e-commerce as compatible with preferred work practices and existing technology infrastructure, and perceive e-commerce as useful for their firms.

While we know that the telecommunication industry is in distress, we also observe a phenomenal, indeed unprecedented explosion of the use of mobile wireless devices and services all over the globe. This paper presents a balanced introduction to wireless technology including devices, mobile operating systems, and communication protocols. It discusses standardization efforts, technology evolution paths, and several new and potentially disruptive technologies, some still in the research stage. The paper lists leading global wireless service providers in terms of the number of domestic subscribers and presents an analysis of the six U.S. national operators including their strengths and weaknesses. Only four of them are profitable now. Although the consumer market currently dictates technology evolution, several examples of successful business applications of wireless mobile technology are presented.

%X Three related papers recently argued for the adoption of specific 'organizing principles' for academic research in Information Systems. These principles, centered on nomological networks of IT artifacts, are offered as prescriptions which, it is argued, resolve an 'identity crisis' in IS research.  The present paper concludes that, rather than resolving an identity crisis, the prescriptions are likely to confound any search for identity by biasing future IS research into directions that do not move the field forward. We show how a positive science of Information Systems can retain the benefits sought without the recommended prescriptions.

%X This article defines an expanded conceptual framework for classifying and describing Decision Support Systems (DSS) that consists of one primary dimension and three secondary dimensions. The primary dimension is the dominant technology component or driver of decision support. The three secondary dimensions are the targeted users, the specific purpose of the system and the primary deployment or enabling technology.   Five generic DSS types are identified and defined based upon the dominant technology component, including Communications-driven, Data-driven, Document-driven, Knowledge-driven, and Model-driven Decision Support Systems. Specific targeted users like individuals, groups, or customers can use any of the five generic types of DSS. Also, a DSS can be created for a decision- specific or a more general purpose. Finally, in the framework, the DSS deployment and enabling technology may be a mainframe computer, a client/server LAN, a spreadsheet or a web-based technology architecture.   The goal in defining an expanded DSS framework is to help researchers better identify meaningful, homogeneous categories for research and to help Information Systems professionals describe and explain the various types of decision support systems.

%X Business intelligence systems combine operational data with analytical tools to present complex and competitive information to planners and decision makers.   The objective is to improve the timeliness and quality of inputs to the decision process. Business Intelligence is used to understand the capabilities available in the firm; the state of the art, trends, and future directions in the markets, the technologies, and the regulatory environment in which the firm competes; and the actions of competitors and the implications of these actions.  The emergence of the data warehouse as a repository, advances in data cleansing, increased capabilities of hardware and software, and the emergence of the web architecture all combine to create a richer business intelligence environment than was available previously.  Although business intelligence systems are widely used in industry, research about them is limited. This paper, in addition to being a tutorial,  proposes a BI framework and potential research topics. The framework highlights the importance of unstructured data and discusses the need to develop BI tools for its acquisition, integration, cleanup, search, analysis, and delivery. In addition, this paper explores a matrix for BI data types (structured vs. unstructured) and data sources (internal and external) to guide research.

This tutorial explores XML applications in business transactions and then focuses on XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language).  XBRL is an application of XML in financial reporting.  XBRL uses accepted financial reporting standards, and allows automatic exchange and reliable extraction of financial statements across all software and technologies. XBRL includes a well-defined dictionary of markups and is supported by many supplementary technologies.  This tutorial explores the following aspects of XBRL: markups, documents and schemas; transformation and processing technologies that support XBRL; tools and software that enable real-world implementation of the language; and audit and control issues associated with XBRL.

%X This case describes how the Australasian Produce Co-Operative (APCO), a marketing co-operative in a land-based industry in 'Australasia' attempted to create a global information system. APCO is among the 20 largest food enterprises in the world. Information systems took on increasing importance as the enterprise refined its global operations in the last decade. In the six years between 1996 and 2002, this case demonstrates the many pitfalls in the process of evolving an international information system as it follows APCO's global system development. It shows the difficulties surrounding the definition of requirements in a large multinational firm and how such a definition is intertwined with the pre-existing politically charged environment that characterizes the global firm. Further, the case demonstrates how the failure of the information technology department to interpret correctly the organization's strategy changes resulted in antagonistic forces in which business resistance finally defeated all attempts to install a standard global information system.

%X This paper offers a rigorous step-by-step methodology for developing theories and contains specific and detailed guidelines for IS researchers to follow in carrying out positivist case studies. The methodology is largely inspired by the work of Yin [2003], Eisenhardt [1989], Miles and Huberman [1994] and several others who are strong proponents of and have wide experience in this research approach. It also relies on previous key contributions to the positivist case research method in IS [Benbasat et al., 1987; Lee, 1989; Dubé and Paré, 2003]. We illustrate how this methodology can be applied in our field to help find new perspectives and empirical insights. In addition, the desired qualities associated with several of the proposed concepts and the techniques and tools included in the methodology are presented. We believe that the two detailed case studies presented in this paper represent highly rigorous, yet different applications of the positivist case research method and, hence, we strongly encourage IS researchers to follow their respective approaches.

A Wiki is a collaboratively created and iteratively improved set of web pages, together with the software that manages the web pages.  Because of their unique way of creating and managing knowledge, Wikis combine the best elements of earlier conversational knowledge management technologies, while avoiding many of their disadvantages.  This article introduces Wiki technology, the behavioral and organizational implications of Wiki use, and Wiki applicability as groupware and help system software.  The article concludes that organizations willing to embrace the "Wiki way" with collaborative, conversational knowledge management systems, may enjoy better than linear knowledge growth while being able to satisfy ad-hoc, distributed knowledge needs.

%X Enterprise Integration (EI) is essential to organisations wishing to fulfill broader business objectives related to e-business, customer relationship management (CRM), supply chain management (SCM) and business-to-business (B2B) commerce.  This paper describes and presents the results of a study into practices for managing technical risk on EI projects.  In the study, 21 managers participated in a facilitated workshop or interview sessions to identify areas of risk (RAs) associated with EI projects and risk management practices (RMP) for addressing those RAs.  Risks were identified in four separate phases in the lifecycle of an EI project, namely the strategy, planning, implementation and rollout phases.  Many of the risks identified were not specific to EI projects, but were applicable to large IT projects in general.  The paper is primarily concerned with technical risk although some aspects of business and organizational risk are discussed briefly.

It presents respondents from six European countries: Germany, Norway, Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, and the Netherlands. The participants address questions about the nature of their PhD programme in terms of such factors as admission, funding, style of dissertation, format of examination, employment prospects. Whilst some patterns exist amongst the experiences, diversity is still considerable. The paper concludes with a discussion of the impact of this evidence for the global field of information systems.

%X Large-scale research Digital Libraries (DLs) contain a large array of potentially useful metadata. Yet, many popular DLs do not provide a convenient way to navigate the metadata or to visualize classification schema in the user session. For example, in the broad world of Management Information Systems (MIS) research, a high-level overview of MIS topics and their inter-relationships would be useful to navigate a MIS DL before zooming in on a specific article. To address this obstacle, this paper describes a prototype, the Technical Report Visualizer System (TRV), which uses a wide variety of open standards to show DL classification metadata in the navigation interface. The system captures MIS article metadata from the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) compliant arXiv e-Print archive at Cornell University. The OAI Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) is used to collect the topic metadata; the articles' Association for Computing Machinery's (ACM) Computing Classification System codes. We display the topic metadata in a Java hyperbolic tree and make use of XML conceptual product and implementation product standards and specifications, such as the Dublin Core and BiblioML bibliographic metadata sets, XML Topic Maps, Xalan and Xerces, to link user navigation activity to the abstracts and full text contents of the articles. We discuss the flexibility and convenience of XML standards and link this effort to related digital library visualization approaches.    Keywords:

Based on the presentations and discussions during a panel at the 2003 Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS), we first present the rationale for incorporating HCI materials in Management Information Systems (MIS) curricula. Second, we present a list of relevant and important HCI knowledge and skills that our students need for effective careers. Third, given the limited number of credit hours available to each MIS program, we explore several strategies and options for the integration of HCI into current and future MIS courses. Finally, drawing upon teaching experiences of the authors, we provide pedagogical suggestions for teaching HCI to undergraduate and graduate students.

%X The issue of whether IS positivist researchers were sufficiently validating their instruments was initially raised fifteen years ago and rigor in IS research is still one of the most critical scientific issues facing the field.  Without solid validation of the instruments that are used to gather data on which findings and interpretations are based, the very scientific basis of the profession is threatened.   This study builds on four prior retrospectives of IS research that conclude that IS positivist researchers continue to face major barriers in instrument, statistical, and other forms of validation.  It goes beyond these studies by offering analyses of the state-of-the-art of research validities and deriving specific heuristics for research practice in the validities.  Some of these heuristics will, no doubt, be controversial.  But we believe that it is time for the IS academic profession to bring such issues into the open for community debate. This article is a first step in that direction.     Based on our interpretation of the importance of a long list of validities, this paper suggests heuristics for reinvigorating the quest for validation in IS research via content/construct validity, reliability, manipulation validity, and statistical conclusion validity. New guidelines for validation and new research directions are offered.

The new department focuses on research that crosses traditional boundaries between information systems (IS) and health informatics disciplines. The purpose of the department is: 1. To increase opportunities for authors to publish health-related research to IS audiences. Submissions intended to meet this first objective should address topics that are interesting to the IS community and add value to the IS literature stream. 2. To support the efforts of researchers who conduct studies crossing IS and healthcare disciplines. Submission is encouraged for studies of the research process, tutorials, panel discussions, information system design and implementation studies, case studies, and other materials that will help researchers to create and carry out high-quality research in the area.

%X If object-oriented programmers are more productive than other programmers, they should be paid more, assuming that wages are determined based on the value of a worker's marginal productivity.  The human capital model is used to assess the current salary premiums of programmers who know object-oriented programming (OOP).  While the human capital model employed quantifies this premium, it also controls for the effects of different amounts of technical experience and different levels of education (highest attained degree) that the programmers possess.  Using two samples, the incremental value of OOP skills is shown to be about the same over the two different time periods (2000/2001 and 2003).

They may, however, be missing, a large, untapped clientele--people with disabilities who want to donate, volunteer, or access services of a NPO. If NPO homepages are not accessible to the growing population of people with disabilities, they may not be doing their job. This study assesses 100 NPO homepages to determine how accessible they are. The overall results show that only 10% of all NPO homepages examined are truly accessible.

%X Outsourcing is now a widely accepted part of dong business. What started as a mechanism to lower costs became an integral part of a much larger IT strategy. Today, newer forms of outsourcing are on the horizon and newer approaches that will change yet again how IT sourcing decisions are made. Better connectivity, the availability of high quality staff, and much lower costs in other countries are changing sourcing markets and expanding sourcing possibilities for companies. To examine how sourcing is changing in IT organizations, the authors convened a focus group of senior IT managers from a variety of companies. This paper explores the evolution of sourcing and how sourcing strategies are shifting. Then it looks at emerging sourcing models and particularly at offshore/nearshore outsourcing. Finally, it identifies critical factors for successful sourcing. The paper concludes that while sourcing is changing the nature of the work that is done internally in IT, it is unlikely that it will eliminate this function altogether or reduce the its value to that of a utility. To the contrary, more and more organizations will need the systems thinking, architectural understanding, and strategic awareness embodied in a modern IT department to ensure that they don't end up with a hollow shell of an organization which provides limited added value to the marketplace.

%X Many in the IS community are aware of the importance of communication practices in building a sustainable community. Yet, surprisingly, little is known about the practices and perceptions of communication within our field. In this study, members of the ISWorld listserv were surveyed for their patterns of use and involvement, their opinions on the roles and management of the listserv, and their recommendations for design. A complementary archival analysis, which includes an analysis of the 9-11 aftermath and an analysis of how people respond to requests for information, corroborated some of the survey results. The survey results suggest that members are generally satisfied with the listserv but much more can still be done to improve its conduct and design. Moreover, more research can and should be conducted on the listserv and on other forms of communication within the IS community. We enumerate several research topics that emerged from this study.

%X For over 20 years, researchers expressed their concern for the lack of theoretical development in the Information Systems discipline and the lack of a cumulative research tradition. The aim of this study is to investigate the intellectual structure of the IS discipline through an analysis of 993 mainstream research articles published in selected journals and proceedings during the previous decade (1991-2000). We explore the variety of researcher perspectives in the discipline, based on the theoretical frameworks adopted by these studies. This examination shows the relative "mindshare" of different theoretical frameworks and informs the self-reflection that is frequently undertaken in our discipline. The study generates categorizations to map theories to frameworks, which are then located in a three-dimensional ontology. The resulting mappings should help researchers understand the scope of past IS research and identify gaps in theoretical development.

%X In the family of programming languages derived from the C programming language, the order of evaluation of expressions between sequence points is left undefined and may be counterintuitive. While most programmers assume that this lack of a defined order refers only to a lack of preference between left-to-right and right-to-left sequential evaluation, the standards actually permit, and language processors implement, a variety of non-sequential evaluation orders.  In some cases, particularly those where expressions containing sequence points are combined without an intervening sequence point, computed results can be unanticipated, and can vary with different compilers for the same code. Yet these results fail to trigger any warning from compilers or syntax-checkers. Because languages of the C family dominate Information Systems curricula and new business application code, the risk that code in those languages may give incorrect results without any warning from automated tools presents significant hazards against the integrity of financial calculations. This article explains those hazards and outlines countermeasures.

The study is based on innovation diffusion and entrepreneurship theory and uses a combination of in-depth interviews and survey methodologies. The data, obtained in Indonesia, show that most early adopters are highly educated, have previous IT-related work experience, and score high on the 'entrepreneurial readiness' variable. Students and youngsters are the main market segments. Early and late adopters alike are innovative. Innovation diffusion depends on adequate infrastructure and awareness among potential customers. Policy recommendations include increasing government commitment to infrastructure development to provide more equitable access to information in society.

%X Resistance is frequently viewed as a negative aspect of human interaction. Although resistance manifests itself in numerous ways, resistance to change is frequent when individuals are introduced to new ideas or innovations. This form of resistance can limit forward progress of either an individual or an organization. However, a few papers  investigated possible positive roles of resistance in human life. This paper proposes that resistance can be a positive motivator to achieve change. Open source software (OSS) is a technological innovation that is laden with aspects of resistance. One of the initial motivations for the development of open source software was "psychological reactance"  on the part of a few software developers. Reactance is a limited part of the overall construct of resistance; specifically, resistance caused by external threats to an individual's freedom of choice, which generally manifests itself affectively.  This paper looks at the role of resistance as a motivator for technological innovation from the perspective of open source softwre  development. It also presents techniques for overcoming resistance to the adoption of open source software. Specific techniques presented are the Alpha and Omega strategies for overcoming resistance. Alpha strategies work by attempting to increase the approach forces towards some goal. Conversely, Omega strategies attempt to decrease the avoidance forces, thereby removing resistance to change. Both techniques are used in the context of open source software development to motivate participants.

%X Research publication in peer-reviewed journals is an important avenue for knowledge dissemination. However, information on journal review process metrics are often not available to prospective authors, which may preclude effective targeting of their research work to appropriate outlets. We study these metrics for information systems (IS) researchers through a survey of actual author experiences of the IS journal review process. Our results provide a knowledge base of  the length and quality of the review process in various journals;  responsiveness of the journal office and publication delay; and  correlations of metrics with published studies of journal rankings.  The data should  enable authors to make effective submission decisions, as well as help to benchmark journal review processes among competing journals.

%X Ghana was one of the first countries in sub-Saharan Africa to gain Internet access. By 1996 it three Internet service providers (ISPs) were competing.  During the Internet boom years, 1998-2000, the ISP and Internet Café industries in Ghana grew rapidly.   In 2004, policy-makers are struggling with the question of how to fund telecommunications deployment in rural Ghana.  The question is urgent because use of Voice over IP (VoIP) technology for international voice calls ate away at Ghana Telecom's profits; profits the company says it desperately needs to fund deployment of a new telephone network.   We use the Global Diffusion of the Internet (GDI) framework to examine Internet diffusion in Ghana along six dimensions: Pervasiveness, Geographical Dispersion, Sectoral Absorption, Connectivity Infrastructure, Organizational Infrastructure, and Sophistication of Use.  As shown by this analysis, Internet diffusion in Ghana did not evolved along these six dimensions since 2000.  To reinvigorate Internet diffusion, we suggest that the Ghanaian government should allow some ISPs to operate in the rural VoIP and cellular markets on the condition that they invest their profits and use their expertise to build infrastructure in underserved areas.  The Ghana ISP Association (GISPA) should take the lead in building a national backbone with Internet exchange.

Many myths exist about different aspects of wireless computing. The purpose of this article is to examine the more prominent popular beliefs in this area. We address these beliefs using a framework consisting of three dimensions: technology, business, and society. For technology, wireless' limited bandwidth and its effect on new wireless applications and services are discussed. For business, the anticipated revenue opportunities of Wi-Fi and mobile e-commerce are addressed. For society, issues of wireless security and its effect on wireless adoption are examined. Based on these examinations, we propose research directions along each dimension.

%X This article is the first of two whose goal is to advance the discussion of IS risk by addressing limitations of the current IS risk literature. These limitations include: inconsistent or unclear definitions of risk,  	limited applicability of risk models,        frequent omission of the temporal nature of risk, and  	lack of an easily communicated organizing framework for risk factors.  This article presents a general, but broadly adaptable model of system-related risk. The companion article, (CAIS Volume 14, Article 2) focuses on IS risk factors and how these factors can be organized.  This article starts by identifying criteria for a general, but broadly applicable risk model. It compares alternative conceptualizations of risk and provides clarifications of the definitions of risk and of different treatments of goals, expectations, and baselines for assessing risk. It presents several of the risk models in the IS literature and discusses the temporal nature of risk.  Based on that background it presents a general and broadly adaptable model of risk that encompasses: goals and expectations,  risk factors and other sources of uncertainty,  the operation of the system or project whose risks are being managed, the risk management effort,  the possible outcomes and their probabilities,  impacts on other systems, and the resulting financial gains or losses.  The model's adaptability allows users to eliminate facets that are not important for their purposes. For example, the majority of current practitioners would probably think of risk in terms of negative outcomes rather than the full distribution of possible outcomes.  A comparison of the general model with other risk models in the IS literature shows that it covers most of the ideas expressed by previous IS risk models while also providing a practical approach that managers can use for thinking about IS risk at whatever level of detail makes sense to them.

%X This article is the second of two whose goal is to advance the discussion of IS risk by addressing limitations of the current IS risk literature.  The first article (CAIS Volume 14, Article 1)presented a general, but broadly adaptable model of system-related risk that addressed the limited usefulness of existing IS risk models for business managers. In this article, we focus on organizing risk factors to make them more useful and meaningful for business managers.   This article shows how the nine elements of the work system framework can be used to organize the hundreds of risk factors in the IS risk literature.  It also shows that many of the most important and most commonly cited risk factors for IS in operation and IS projects are actually risk factors for work systems in general. Furthermore, risk factors initially associated with one type of system (e.g. ERP implementation) are often equally relevant at other levels (e.g., information systems projects or work systems in general).  Over half of the risk factors in a representative sample of the IS risk literature are valid for work systems in general.  This conclusion is a step toward useful risk diagnostic tools based on an organized set of risk factors that are meaningful to business managers and IT professionals.

For over 20 years, the Department produced and published an annual, non-classified, retrospective Patterns of Global Terrorism report. However, the report for 2003, published on April 29, 2004 was criticized as an attempt to misrepresent data for political advantage. This case is based on official documents, transcripts, and news articles available on the Internet in mid-July 2004. It summarizes the way the situation unfolded and provides a glimpse at how people tried to figure out what happened and how to explain what happened. Although this case occurred in a highly charged political environment, it involves many information system and organizational issues that are important in building and maintaining information systems, especially those that require categorization, coding, consolidation, and interpretation of data regarding customers, employees, sales and service activities, and the surrounding environment.

%X Recent discussion about MIS centers on its role as an academic discipline and the utility of the core IS course in undergraduate business programs. This article presents a summary of a panel discussion at the AMCIS 2003 meeting about these issues. In includes the results of a survey on what elements of the IS 2002.1 Introduction to MIS course are being used that was presented. It also presents the discussions among panel participants and the audience and the panelists emerging perspective on the topic. Some advocate a reduction in the focus on systems and technology in the core IS course. However, we believe that this view is an over-reaction to concerns about the course, and suggest (as did many before us) that systems theory is a central organizing them of the core IS course. We believe that the response by the field should not be to water down our core course, but to identify our contribution and highlight it. To this end, we offer a concise statement of what we believe is the heart of the core IS course.

%X The theory underlying US securities laws is that investors are helpless without reliable information [Zelizer, 2002]. When Enron's collapse and other corporate frauds made it clear that "practically every element of our system of safeguards failed until it was too late to repair the damage," Congress reinforced those laws by passing the Sarbanes-Oxley (SARBOX) Act [O'Malley, 2002]. This new law demands that C-suite executives confirm their confidence in the quality and integrity of information generated by information systems by signing the figures off personally.  Under SARBOX, the Securities and Exchange Commission holds executives accountable for reliable internal controls, record retention, and fraud detection. In turn, executives are looking to information systems and to IS auditors to help them meet their regulatory responsibilities.  This article discusses SARBOX mandates and the intent of regulatory agencies. That understanding lays the foundation needed to develop holistic SARBOX compliance programs with information technology and business process improvements. Holistic compliance is an enterprise-wide and long-term approach that views the new law as opportunities to improve internal controls and public reporting. Holistic compliance stands in contrast to simply complying with the rules or silo compliance; i.e., efforts scattered throughout business silos. We identify SARBOX requirements ("sections") concerning IS and IS research. Research areas to achieve minimal compliance include methods for IS assurance and auditing, risk management, and electronic records management (ERM). Research in business intelligence, data warehousing and mining, and supply chain management are necessary for holistic compliance that improves competitive position. While research efforts in these areas are not new, regulations have made them more compelling and urgent issues for senior management.

%X This paper motivates a comprehensive academic study of metadata and the roles that metadata plays in organizational information systems. While the benefits of metadata and challenges in implementing metadata solutions are widely addressed in practitioner publications, explicit discussion of metadata in academic literature is rare. Metadata, when discussed, is perceived primarily as a technology solution. Integrated management of metadata and its business value are not well addressed. This paper discusses both the benefits offered by and the challenges associated with integrating metadata. It also describes solutions for addressing some of these challenges. The inherent complexity of an integrated metadata repository is demonstrated by reviewing the metadata functionality required in a data warehouse: a decision support environment where its importance is acknowledged. Comparing this required functionality with metadata management functionalities offered by data warehousing software products identifies crucial gaps. Based on these analyses, topics for further research on metadata are proposed.

What is agent technology and what has led to its enormous popularity in both the academic and commercial worlds? Agent-based system technology offers a new paradigm for designing and implementing software systems. The objective of this tutorial is to provide an overview of agents, intelligent agents and multi-agent systems, covering such areas as:  1. what an agent is, its origins and what it does,  2. how intelligence is defined for and differentiates an intelligent agent from an agent,  3. how multi-agent systems coordinate agents with competing goals to achieve a meaningful result, and  4. how an agent differs from an object of a class or an expert system.  Examples are presented of academic and commercial applications that employ agent technology. The potential pitfalls of agent development and agent usage are discussed.

%X Computer users face a new and growing threat to security and privacy.  This threat is not in the form of direct attacks by viruses or hackers, but rather by indirect infiltration in the form of monitoring programs surreptitiously installed on computers. These monitoring applications are called spyware, and serve to record and transmit a user's computer uses and behaviors to third parties.  Frequently used by marketers to harvest customer data for segmentation and targeting purposes, spyware can serve to direct targeted advertising to user's computers. Spyware is often legally used since installations can be authorized as part of the licensed "clickwrap" agreement that users agree to when downloading free utility and file sharing programs from the Internet. In some cases, spyware is installed as part of legitimate computer applications provided by business to their customers, to provide updating and communicative functionality to application users. It appears that the ability to monitor remotely and communicate with computers is an opportunity attractive enough to attract the attention of third parties with non-legal intentions.  This article focuses on the roles and functions of spyware, its use in both legitimate and non-legitimate ways, and a range of preventions and protections for avoiding and removing spyware that has been installed on end user computers.

%X Healthcare is a large and growing industry that is experiencing major transformation in its information technology base. IS confronted similar transformations in other industries and developed theories and methods that should prove useful in healthcare applications. In turn, IS may benefit from incorporating knowledge from health informatics, a discipline that studies IT within medical and healthcare contexts. Despite the benefits, it is often a struggle for interdisciplinary researchers in IS and healthcare to publish their work, especially in journals directed toward IS audiences. In this paper, we outline strategies and resources to help ease this publication bottleneck. As a part of our discussion, we identify and categorize journal outlets for interdisciplinary research in IS and healthcare.

%X Although e-business is increasingly important to companies competing in global markets, rushed and ineffective implementation of e-business in companies results in valuable resources being wasted without achieving significant tangible benefits. To minimize risks and maximize potential benefits in e-business implementation, a company needs to know to what degree it is ready for e-business and in what aspects it needs to improve itself before implementing e-business.   Although a few e-readiness assessment models are used in practice, relatively little is published in academic research journals on this issue. Further, the current practical e-readiness assessment models are largely based on the experience of e-business implementation in developed countries. Given the key differences between developed and developing countries, e-business implementation in developing countries could be different from that in developed countries. This paper proposes an e-readiness assessment framework from the perspective of developing countries. The assessment framework contains five hierarchical levels, including 67 specific assessment indicators. Two field studies were conducted to illustrate and test the usability of the proposed e-readiness assessment framework in 21 retail companies of China.

%X Media selection is a complex issue that may involve weighing factors such as media features (richness), user characteristics, and tasks. This study examines user perceptions about instant messengers (IM) compared to email (EM). It compares the relation of eight motivation variables with past experience (desktop and wireless) and future use intention (social interactions and work/coursework). Our results, based on a student survey, show that, for this population, frequency of use may predict the adoption of new technology, such as IM, but results in  little or no effect on media that already enjoy widespread adoption. Years of media use did not affect IM or EM adoption. This study finds no evidence of a relationship between the availability of wireless access and user perceptions of IM and EM. IM adopters tend to use IM for both social reasons and work/coursework. These users expressed a strong intention for future use of IM. No significant difference was found in expected EM future use between the IM-adopters and non-adopters.

%X Knowledge Management is an expanding field of study.  In this paper we clarify and explain some of the terms and concepts that underlie this field.  In particular we discuss knowledge and its related philosophies; how the sociotechnical aspects of organizations can assist in knowledge management and how communities of practice can thus be supported; how knowledge can be valued in an organization; and the idea of intellectual capital.  We conclude that knowledge management is not an easy 'fix' to an organisation's problems.  Implemented well it can increase productivity, improve worker collaboration, and shorten product development times.  Implemented badly it may incur significant costs without delivering these benefits.

%X Colleges and universities in the United States with undergraduate programs offer undergraduate Management Information Systems  programs in their business schools to complement and balance computer science and computer engineering  curricula. Similar institutions in the English-speaking Caribbean, however, slant their computing studies overwhelmingly toward Computer Science , which produces technologists for the IT industry.  Although the vast majority of their graduates are engaged in applying technology solutions to information problems in business organizations, these English-speaking Caribbean institutions offer limited MIS programs, which prepare graduates for such roles. This article examines undergraduate computing curricula in the Caribbean and compares them with others elsewhere in the world. It recommends that English-speaking Caribbean universities give similar prominence to MIS education in their business programs in order to equip graduates to create more effective IT-enabled business solutions.

%X KM is experiencing the steep downward slope of the "hype cycle" and some organizations are rushing to abandon KM as quickly as they rushed to adopt it. Unfortunately, much of our understanding of what KM can do for organizations is still limited to academic treatises and small pilot studies. Managers therefore realize they must market KM more effectively in order to communicate its potential and build a coalition of support while KM matures and evolves. To explore this issue, the authors convened a focus group of practicing knowledge managers. After examining how KM groups currently market themselves, this paper constructs a framework for marketing KM in an organization that integrates the experiences of KM managers with basic marketing principles. It concludes that KM faces many marketing challenges, including lack of understanding of the need, lack of brand awareness, and a negative brand attitude. It recommends that knowledge managers must see themselves as internal entrepreneurs, first building a market for their product and then developing an effective marketing strategy. It also suggests there is a hierarchy of knowledge needs in organizations that must be addressed sequentially in order to develop trust and credibility among general business managers.

All of the articles in seven mainstream MIS journals were examined in terms of subjects researched and methodologies employed to conduct research.  Recent trends are presented and compared to those of the earlier study.  The results clearly indicate the focus of efforts of researchers on information system usage and information systems resource management.  The survey methodology still appeals to many researchers but increases in the use of mathematical models and laboratory experiments is an indication that the field is attaining maturity by using more rigorous research methods.

%X This article examines the impact of Global IT Outsourcing on Information Technology (IT) firms from the off-shore sourcing perspective.  IT Providers are defined in this article as companies that produce IT as opposed to companies that consume IT.  To assess the impact of outsourcing on such companies, this article presents an Enterprise Architecture (EA) view of IT and uses it as the framework to determine the impact of outsourcing.   The three dimensions of Enterprise Architecture include people, process and product and/or services.  The article argues that if the sourcing decisions are based purely on short term goals such as cost, then the long term viability of the IT firm may be compromised.  Lack of an IT development model and lack of IT metrics makes it difficult for IT Providers to truly plan and manage the off-shore resources.  This article suggests that shorter development cycles, requirements volatility, and the need for constant developer-user interaction makes off-shore outsourcing more difficult. To address these challenges, organizations should develop metrics and governance practices based on experience.   This article also proposes that the type of product or service is critical in addressing the decision to outsource.  The higher the intellectual (or proprietary) content, the higher is the risk when outsourcing.  This article presents two simple frameworks, one for assessing the benefits and risk of outsourcing for IT infrastructure services and the other for IT applications.  IT Providers are advised to pay particular attention to the life cycle model of off-shoring where early gains give way to a learning and adjustment phase.  If the IT firm successfully develops a rich experience base and adjusts the off shore model, then sustained benefits can be realized.

This paper, which draws upon discussions conducted in a panel at the 21st ICIS conference in Brisbane, examines ethical issues associated with three key components of the research process: design, data collection and analysis; writing; and reviewing. The implications of these issues for the IS research community are discussed. Example scenarios are used to illuminate the issues faced by authors and reviewers. After considering the alternatives of strict guidelines enforced by bureaucratic structures, self regulation without guidelines and self regulation through norms set by a code of practice, the last option is recommended because it can lead to better practice in a constructive fashion without either excessive bureaucratic intervention or a "free-for-all" where "anything goes".

%X Data warehousing is a strategic business and IT initiative in many organizations today.  Data warehouses can be developed in two alternative ways -- the data mart and the enterprise-wide data warehouse strategies -- and each has advantages and disadvantages.   To create a data warehouse, data must be extracted from source systems, transformed, and loaded to an appropriate data store.  Depending on the business requirements, either relational or multidimensional database technology can be used for the data stores.  To provide a multidimensional view of the data using a relational database, a star schema data model is used.  Online analytical processing can be performed on both kinds of database technology.  Metadata about the data in the warehouse is important for IT and end users.  A variety of data access tools and applications can be used with a data warehouse - SQL queries, management reporting systems, managed query environments, DSS/EIS, enterprise intelligence portals, data mining, and customer relationship management.  A data warehouse can be used to support a variety of users - executive, managers, analysts, operational personnel, customers, and suppliers.  Data warehousing concepts are brought to life through a case study of Harrah's Entertainment, a firm that became a leader in the gaming industry with its CRM business strategy supported by data warehousing.

%X Though many companies are still just beginning to grasp the potential uses and impacts of the Web and e-commerce, advances in technologies and their application continue. These advances often present various managerial and technological issues for individuals, companies, governments, and other entities. One significant area of technological advancement is the development of mobile e-commerce, which encompasses interactive business activities and processes related to a (potential) commercial transaction conducted through communications networks that interface with wireless devices. These systems provide the potential for organizations and users to perform various commerce-related tasks without regard to time and location (anytime from anywhere). This emerging mobile e-commerce environment presents a new set of issues. This paper identifies and categorizes some of these issues so that researchers, developers, and managers have a starting point for focusing their activities within the emerging m-commerce domain. Our examination finds categories that include technological (both client and infrastructure) issues, application issues, and areas for future research.

%X China  is a large economy with a large absolute gross domestic product (GDP.)However, its huge population brings its GDP and wealth level per capita way below developed countries and in-line with many developing countries. 	Between 1900 and 2001, China's economy experienced rapid growth (7-8% on average)  as did its telecommunications, information technology (IT) and Internet infrastructures (50% - 200% on average).  Its large population brings the penetration rates of these infrastructures way below developed countries and a little higher than many developing countries. 	China's infrastructure is characterized by "disparities" among geographic areas, demographics, and firm size.  Large cities and economically advanced coastal provinces enjoy much better infrastructure and many more Internet users than remote and economically poorer provinces.  Large enterprises have bigger IT budgets and better-trained staffs than small- and medium-sized enterprises.  A younger population with higher education is more likely to adopt Internet and e-commerce.  	The infrastructure disparity leads to e-commerce diffusion disparity. Current e-commerce activities are concentrated in large cities, coastal provinces, large enterprises, and among well-educated young people.  The legal environment for e-commerce is better in large cities and coastal provinces because they publish local laws regarding e-commerce and IT infrastructure. 	Barriers to e-commerce diffusion include poor technical infrastructure, lack of security, lack of a system to monitor and guarantee buyer and seller credibility, and an inefficient delivery system.  The lack of a credibility monitoring system extends to both vendors and individual consumers.  	Taxation and privacy, which are vital to e-commerce diffusion in many other countries, do not appear to be serious concerns yet.  However, content censorship is among the top concerns. 	The most significant driving forces are government promotion and private entrepreneurial desire to make profits.  Government initiatives include general promotion of the IT industry, an industrial and regulatory policy to foster competition among service providers, encouragement of E-government, and sponsorship of projects to mobilize public awareness, such as the "Enterprise Online Project" and "Home Online Project".  	The poor infrastructure for e-commerce in China pulled e-commerce back to a base building stage after an initial explosive stage.  Significant diffusion can only occur after a solid infrastructure is built up, including the technical and legal infrastructure.  	Two examples, an E-store for residents in a local living complex and the E-system for college admissions, demonstrate e-commerce models unique in China.

%X Due to its economic power as the largest economy in Europe and third largest in the world, Germany inevitably will play an important role in e-commerce.  	After the improvement and diffusion of high-speed Internet access, like ISDN or DSL, Germany enjoys more ISDN telephone lines than any country; also the highest DSL per capita ratio, in Europe.  	Germany includes a large, highly educated and relatively wealthy population, which is an important prerequisite for successful e-commerce activities. Due to foreign language skills in the German population (every pupil is required to learn English; a large number know basic French or Spanish, too), the language barrier to using international Web sites is small. Moreover, the German education system puts increasing emphasis on information and communications technology (ICT) skills.  	Invention activity in some areas of ICT shows signs of improvement. Starting from a low level, patent activity in mobile communications and the Internet grew faster in Germany than anywhere else in Europe. This growth could be viewed as an early indicator of strengthening the mobile e-commerce sector in Germany and may be interpreted as an important effort in catching-up with overall e-commerce development. 	More than 80% of the GNP is created in mid-sized companies (Mittelstand), which traditionally are considered as more flexible and innovative than large enterprises. The majority of these small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can access the Internet. Looking at Internet penetration, German SMEs are at the top together with SMEs in Scandinavian countries.  	The central position of Germany as a hub to Europe together with the excellent public and private transport infrastructure is a competitive advantage to attract foreign investments. 	Germany follows the innovation model "be the best imitator of successful developments" and within this course exploits the competitive advantage achievable through integration. After e-commerce technologies proved successful, Germany caught up in developing its relevant infrastructure and is now gaining momentum.

%X According to most indicators, the use of the Internet and the development of e-commerce (over the Internet) in France are below the level that should be reached given the French level of development. 	This observation can be explained by the late adoption of digital technologies by the French. However, the French lateness is less important for professional uses than for domestic uses. France began to catch up with pioneering countries during 1999-2000, but the collapse Internet bubble reduced the pace of adoption. 	The French late adoption of digital technologies is partly the result of the strong involvement of France in the development of two pre-existing technologies: Minitel (principally dedicated to B2C) and EDI (dedicated to B2B). Both technologies provided the users with a sufficient level of service to support their business processes, but hindered their propensity to switch to new Internet-based technology. Consequently, most available indicators underestimate the actual level of e-commerce in France, especially the French business readiness to switching to Web-based commerce. 	The late adoption of technology was not the only inhibitor for e-commerce. In France's recent economic history, decision makers focused for too long on other issues. France had to adapt its economy and its industry to a competitive and global environment. Since the State played a strong role in an economy that was not widely open to competition, a wide set of reforms took place between the mid-1980s and the late 1990s.  	However, this restructuring policy prepared France for the adoption of e-commerce. as France was transformed into a service economy. Most organizations became more flexible by externalizing non-core activities and by implementing modular principles of organization. French companies went international as well. This new business climate favored the adoption of e-business and e-commerce practice by the end of the 1990s. 	When macroeconomic and industrial restructurings were achieved, the French government launched a strong information society policy. Since 1998, the government furthered the deregulation of telecommunication services, reshaped the legal framework to adapt to digital technologies, promoted IT training and innovation, and developed e-government. 	These policies were both a component of and aligned with the year 2000 e-Europe initiative of the European Union (EU), which promoted the development of a strong digital economy. Specific support programs (in RD and development of content) were combined and an intensive effort for legislation and inter-member benchmarking occurred (to stimulate member states to align on the most advanced state), the Commission and the Council of the EU tried try to stimulate development of a dynamic digital industry in Europe, and to boost the adoption of digital technologies and the new-methods of work and business enabled by them.  	While the European and the French policies impacted the adoption of digital technologies and e-commerce development significantly, they were insufficient to really enable France to catch up. The bursting of the Internet bubble slowed the pace. Moreover, B2C e-commerce was inhibited by the efficiency of the French distribution system that serves at a low cost alternative to the Internet for most of the population. The existing installed base of EDI, especially in the automobile and distribution industries, inhibits B2B e-commerce over the Internet. Consequently, the French e-commerce path of development is unique since it relies less on the Internet than in many other countries. Despite these inhibitors, France is adopting digital technologies and related practices at a higher pace than the other European countries. 	Within France, e-commerce is quite different in the various regions and industries. The Paris area (one-fifth of the French population), the IT industry, the professional services and distribution industries, and large companies are as intensively digitized as most advanced countries, industries, and companies worldwide.

%X This article examines Mexico as one of the countries in Latin America where e-commerce expanded the most, second only to Brazil, and where a digital economy is emerging as a result of a complex set of factors. Key environmental factors that exert an important influence on e-commerce diffusion include the performance of the economy, the sectoral and business structure of the economy, the size of the population, and the distribution of national income.  It is hypothesized in this paper that two critical factors that determine the pace, quality and orientation of e-commerce are:   1. the work of private organizations devoted to promoting e-commerce practices, and  2. the political will the Mexican government demonstrated in recent years to improve the country's telecommunications infrastructure.  These two factors reinforce one another in the sense that promoting organizations operates by means of specialized working groups whose membership includes representatives from the federal government.  Jointly, these institutions create a favorable environment and the required physical conditions for the development of both business-to-business and business-to-consumer e-commerce transactions.

%X In Brazil, high inflation rates and public policies for local information technology (IT) development encouraged the early adoption of IT, including electronic data interchange (EDI), especially in the banking industry. 	Starting in the early 1970s, Brazil developed capabilities both in the production and use of information technologies. Mexico and Brazil are the only Latin American countries with substantial IT hardware production.  	Since inflation control became the highest priority in economic policy in the 1990s, the Brazilian economy has grown at a relatively slow pace compared to historical growth rates. Brazil ranks third in the Americas in GDP value. However, in per capita terms, it falls behind the top five wealthiest countries in Latin America. 	Education levels increased substantially in the last decade. Primary education is almost universal (95.7%). 78.5% of the population in the secondary education age group is enrolled, compared to less than 60% in 1992. 	In 2000, investments in telecommunications as a percentage of the GDP were the highest in Latin America. In the last four years, fixed line teledensity doubled while cellular subscribers quintupled. In per capita terms, Brazil is now at the Latin American average, both in fixed lines and cellular phones. In 2000, teledensity was about 23 fixed lines per 100 people, 15% of whom were connected to the Internet.  	The development of the Internet in Brazil was somewhat similar to the NSF Net program in the United States. The National Research Network (RNP) began to operate a national backbone in 1991. In 1996, the backbone became available for commercial purposes. 	The government is active in promoting e-commerce diffusion, especially through the e-government initiative. This initiative includes on-line purchasing, government information, tax collection, and other applications. However, government programs lack coordination and resources.  	The use of the Internet as a business tool is most advanced in information- related sectors such as finance, communications, information services, and other services that can easily be digitized. The banking sector leads e-commerce diffusion, followed by government and retailing. 	Consumers in countries such as Brazil are increasingly demanding products from Web sites located in their own countries. To succeed in the Brazilian e-commerce market, multinational Internet companies need to invest in local content and distribution networks. 	Although the diffusion of the Internet presents many opportunities for social development, notably in the fields of education, health, and information,  the future growth of e-commerce in Brazil may be limited by social and economic factors such as income level, income distribution, and education.

%X NIBCO, Inc., a mid-sized manufacturer of valves and pipe fittings headquartered in the U.S. with $460 million annual revenues, implemented SAP R/3 across its 10 plants and 4 new distribution centers with a Big Bang approach in December 1997. NIBCO management agreed with the Boston Consulting Group recommendation to "cut loose" from its existing legacy systems and replace them with common, integrated systems for finance, materials management, production, and sales/distribution, such as offered in the ERP packages of major vendors by the second half of the 1990s. However, the company leaders chose not to heed the advice of their consultants, or the current trade press, about taking a slower, phased-in approach. Instead, they developed plans for a Big Bang implementation of all modules (except HR) with a $17 million budget and a project completion date 15 months later that allowed for only a 30-day grace period. The project is led by a triad of NIBCO managers with primary accountabilities for business process, IT, and change management. The case describes the legacy IT environment, the ERP purchase and implementation partner choices, the selection and composition of what came to be called the TIGER team, the workspace design for the project team (TIGER den), the key issues addressed by each project sub-team, the incentive scheme, and the complexity added by a distribution center consolidation initiative that runs behind schedule. The case story ends shortly after the Go Live date, with the project leaders replaying their warnings to the executive team about initial dips in productivity and profits. This case study can be used to demonstrate the tradeoffs between Big Bang versus slower ERP implementation approaches that allow time for organizational learning. Students can identify the technology and organizational risks associated with ERP projects in general, and Big Bang implementations in particular, and then assess how well NIBCO's leaders manage these risks over the life of the project. Specific examples of communications and training initiatives, including ways to achieve employee buy-in, are detailed in the case so that students can better understand change management practices in the context of a major system implementation.

This review provides the rationale for developing a new theory, based on Darwin's theory of evolution,  that is neither technological nor social.  Three theoretical principles are developed from evolution theory: media naturalness, innate schema similarity, and learned schema variety. The article concludes by illustrating how the theoretical principles can be used as a basis for developing a simple predictive model in the context of an online broker.

%X The last few years witnessed the increasing internal and external use of the Internet by organizations.  Web sites grew in sophistication from conventional sites composed of a simple collection of Web pages for public relations or marketing to complex Web information systems dealing with business-to-customer transactions or business-to-business networks.  However, most organizations still do not have a formal process of Web site development, and corporate Web sites are often developed in an unorganized and uncoordinated fashion.  The results of this chaotic situation include slow delivery, conflicting standards, discrepancies with respect to corporate objectives, and redundant development efforts.    To help alleviate this situation, this paper presents the W software life cycle model for corporate web site development along with an associated methodology to guide Web development groups in their endeavors.  The proposed process model and methodology are based on insights gleaned by studying development projects for three types of corporate Web sites: intranets, Web-presence sites, and transactional sites.  However, because Web information systems are more complex, the article also provides recommendations for how the methodology can be adapted to handle these types of applications better.

%X Companies can build a data warehouse using a top-down or a bottom-up approach, and each has its advantages and disadvantages. With the top-down approach, a project team creates an enterprise data warehouse that combines data from across the organization, and end-user applications are developed after the warehouse is in place. This strategy is likely to result in a scaleable data warehouse, but like most large IT projects, it is time consuming, expensive, and may fail to deliver benefits within a reasonable timeframe. With the bottom-up approach, a project team begins by creating a data mart that has a limited set of data sources and that meets very specific user requirements. After the data mart is complete, subsequent marts are developed, and they are conformed to data structures and processes that are already in place. The data marts are incrementally architected into an enterprise data warehouse that meets the needs of users across the organization. The appeal of the data mart strategy is that a mart can be built quickly, at relatively little cost and risk, while providing a proof of concept for data warehousing.  The risk is that the initial data mart will not scale into an enterprise data warehouse, and what has been built will have to be scrapped and redone.   This article provides a case study of Sherwin-Williams' successful use of the bottom-up, data mart strategy. It provides background information on Sherwin-Williams, the data warehousing project, the benefits being realized from the warehouse, and the lessons learned. The case is a "textbook example" of how to successfully execute a data mart strategy. Video clips of interviews with key individuals at Sherwin-Williams help bring the case alive.

%X Two detailed public reports on the Australian Federal Government's Clustered-Agency Information Technology Outsourcing Initiative were published recently. By analyzing these reports and drawing on additional material from various websites, it was possible to piece together four important lessons from the Australian Government's A$1.2 billion 1997-2000 IT outsourcing experience. The lessons are: First, because of increased coordination costs, attempting to group a number of disparate departments to achieve economies of scale in single omnibus contracts does not work. Second, if massive change projects are to succeed, senior management must be committed to the project,   and the needs and aspirations of all employees need to be handled fairly and sensitively. Third, making the transition to outsourcing is hard. Even with all the expert advice at its disposal, the Australian Government's IT outsourcing Initiative experienced enormous difficulties in transitioning to external service provision. Finally, cost savings are hard to achieve and surprisingly hard to measure.  Many of these lessons were learnt before and are well documented in the literature. That they had to be re-learnt by these new players is itself an important lesson.

The applicability of IS research done by academics is evident in the concepts and explanations in many textbooks. There should be little surprise, however, that practitioners who expect readability and direct applicability have little patience for IS publications shaped by the concerns and expectations of academia. It might be possible to broaden the acceptance and relevance of IS research publications by distributing them in both a short version designed to demonstrate relevance and a long version designed to demonstrate rigor and provide supporting details

%X The author spent much of the years prior to January 2000 as an international consultant for Y2K issues.  During this period, a very large quantity of quantitative and qualitative data has been collected, together with many one-to-one interviews with very prominent IT leaders in business.  This data led to extensive empirical research concerning the "real ills" of the IT/IS industry, with fascinating results.  The phenomenology we have seen, in tens of installations, each with hundreds of millions of lines of code (or more) have shown the breadth of gap between academic research and "real world" business Information Technology / Information Systems.  This paper attempts to point out part of this large gap and hopefully, shows some reasons for its continued existence.  This paper is intended to trigger wider interest in IT / IS research.

%X This commentary examines two questions of interest to the relevance debate in IS research: why is relevance a problematic issue in IS research, and how can IS research relevance be assessed accurately and fairly.  Answers to these questions are centered around the pluralistic and dynamic nature of IS research: that IS research is influenced by multiple stakeholder groups with conflicting perspectives, and continuous changes in this domain prevented the formation of a shared consensus of what IS research should be.  Since such a consensus is unlikely to emerge, given the nature of the discipline, any evaluation of IS research relevance must take into account the target audience for that research and yardsticks appropriate for the intended stakeholder groups.

%X At the same time the IT discipline is facing a challenge to the relevance of its scholarship, we also face a severe shortfall of professors.  This shortfall is a long term problem that will have to be met through the use of substitutes for the conventional PhD graduate.  This article argues that developing mid-career, top caliber IT professionals in "practitioner scholar" doctoral programs can help solve both problems.  Practitioner scholars engage in research that is both audience-focused and academically rigorous.  Faculty trained in this way can also bring balance to the classroom, avoiding the extremes of strictly academic or practitioner focused education.

%X The discussion of whether research is relevant should include attention to a frame of reference for the meaning of relevance.  This paper argues that three elements belong in such a frame.  One is a clear identification of what interests or stakes are involved in the research, and whose interests are served.  Another element is whether the research is intended to produce knowledge for its own sake or is intended to solve a particular practical problem.  Lastly, different time frames can lead to completely different judgements about relevance and value.  This complexity suggests considerable caution should apply to evaluating the relevance of IS or any other body of research.

Community Informatics is both a theoretical and practical approach to this area and includes a response to the Digital Divide and ways of developing community based and universally accessible IS applications. In this way IS systems can be developed which are derived from internal models of community process and consensus, alongside Management Information Systems that incorporate models based on organizational hierarchy and command and control processes.

Promotion and tenure committees for academic IS departments, wishing to encourage interaction with IS practice, ought not only to recognize practical experience and publications in trade magazines, but also to design open-architecture career paths for smooth transition of IS personnel between industry and academia.

This expanded notion of relevance incorporates a broader definition of audience/stakeholder, and includes additional dimensions such as scope/value of relevant research,  time frame, and "situatedness" of relevance. In view of this definition, it is argued that "practical relevance" is not the sole goal of academic research.  Hence, the authors recommend, for example, that knowledge claims in IS need to be better communicated and targeted for the future development and recognition of the IS discipline.

%X The question of relevance of the IS discipline is critically important. The issues at hand are: Has the IS discipline fundamentally changed the way we perceive the world? Have the contributions to scholarly research in IS in any way shaped the way we evolved and continue to evolve as individuals and organizations? Who leads whom between academic research and industrial innovations? Are there symbiotic synergies between the two or are they traveling on separate tracks oblivious of the existence of on another?   The IS field is unique compared to other disciplines when viewed in the light of these questions. First, the time gap between research and practice is very narrow (unlike other, comparable disciplines such as computer science and management science where research is mostly way ahead of practice) and the two alternate in leading one another. The relevance question arises only when this gap widens either laterally or linearly, and is unique to IS. Second, because the IS field grew out of the efforts of individuals from several other disciplines, its foundations rest on its interdisciplinary thrusts. Third, given the revolutionary impact of IT in contemporary times, these thrusts have to be tempered with the realism borne out of practice. In this regard, IS is faced with tremendous opportunities, leverages, and challenges. Our thesis is that IS research is not a myth, includes several seminal contributions that basically altered our views of the world, and has a rich and promising road ahead.

Information systems researchers, concerned as we are with the uses of technology, operate under a severe handicap because we do not have opportunities to study new technologies while they are under development.  Our challenge is to find ways to work together on the most relevant questions and to perform research at earlier stages of the technology life cycle.

While I believe that this is not the case, and that dissemination does take place, I am concerned because I believe that academic research should be readable and accessible to practitioners. I suggest that writing for practitioners should be rewarded, but only as a complement to and based upon academic research. Academic research should address important and interesting issues.  It should be relevant to audiences other than businesses, such as the non-profit and public sectors and society at large.

%X Research relevance is an ongoing concern in the IS field. The perceived lack of relevance has its roots in institutional factors. I argue that the current environment offers a great opportunity to influence these institutional factors in the direction of greater incentives for relevant research. I recommend that: 1) Current candidates in the IS faculty market should include relevance as a factor in deciding which position to take, and 2) IS researchers should use the Internet to package and promote their research to develop a constituency outside their academic institutions.

%X The relevance of IS research has long been a hotly debated topic. This article is a living open inquiry about how we may approach the issue of IS research relevance. We observe the nature of the relevance discussion and highlight conceptual distinctions used by the IS community. We raise questions about whether there is an objective truth about IS research relevance. We inquire into the dual nature of concepts in general and its implications for IS research relevance. Finally, we ask if a collective dialogue of a deeper nature can be used to continue this inquiry. It is suggested that an understanding of the issues and questions raised in this meta-inquiry may lie in awareness, insight, and experience rather than in conceptual analysis and hence the implications of the issues should be neither conclusively accepted nor rejected.


%T Architecture of Sysperanto: A Model-Based Ontology of the  IS Field

%X The challenge of defining the domain and core concepts of the IS field is a perennial topic at major IS conferences. This paper describes the architecture of Sysperanto, a model-based ontology of the IS field. Sysperanto is being developed as part of an ongoing effort to create methods that typical business professionals can use to analyze systems and system-related projects for themselves at whatever level of depth is appropriate. The name Sysperanto is meant as a metaphor combining generality (covering the IS field), vocabulary (identification of terms), and structure (internally consistent organization) to create an ontology more powerful and useful than a list of keywords or propositions. Sysperanto's architecture provides an organizing framework for codifying the disparate and inconsistent propositions, methods, and findings that constitute the current state of IS knowledge and, in combination, form a major obstacle to knowledge accumulation and use in the IS field.  Instead of yet another discussion of whether the IS field lacks a conceptual core and what might be the consequences of such a shortcoming, this paper proposes an architecture and preliminary details of a plausible set of core concepts for the IS field. It starts by summarizing Sysperanto's goals and explaining why work system concepts, rather than information system concepts, are the core of Sysperanto. It presents Sysperanto as a terminological ontology and explains the underlying meta-model. The meta-model is designed to support tools for analyzing systems from a business viewpoint and to help in codifying and organizing knowledge in the IS field. It uses a conceptual map based on extensiveness and guidance in application to compare Sysperanto with other efforts to organize ideas in the IS field.   It may be several years before a complete version of Sysperanto is tested through its use in a formal method for analyzing systems or through comparison with other attempts to codify knowledge in the IS field. Nonetheless, its architecture is well enough defined to be compared to the architecture (or lack of architecture) in previous and future approaches for understanding and organizing the basic concepts about information systems.

%X Online prescription filling possesses great market potential; however, consumers' perception of uncertainty tends to impede their adoption of online prescription filling. Trust is recognized as a critical factor affecting online shopping in general. We contend that trust can help consumers overcome perceived uncertainty, thereby enhancing their intention to adopt online prescription filling. Drawing on prior research on trust and theory of transaction cost economics, this paper proposes a research model that encompasses three trust antecedents, two sources of uncertainty, and the relationships among trust, uncertainty, and the consumer's intention to adopt online prescription filling. The model was tested empirically using a large sample. It was found that  (1)	calculus-based, knowledge-based, and institution-based trust antecedents significantly affect trust,  (2)	information asymmetry and online drug retailers' opportunistic behavior contribute to perceived uncertainty,  (3)	trust reduces uncertainty and positively affects intention, and  (4)uncertainty influences intention negatively.

The case is designed to provide the substantial background information needed to y engage successfullin setting direction for IS resources and their use at Outrigger Hotels and Resorts headquartered in Hawaii. It enables students to analyze the firm's strategy thoroughly and to assess its current use of information systems resources. With this assessment as a starting point, students can develop an appropriate IS vision, IS architecture, and the strategic IS plan for Outrigger Hotels and Resorts. The case was originally designed to use the process of setting direction for IS resources as described by Martin and colleagues [2005], but is flexible enough to adapt to the structure of other approaches to planning for information systems use.

%X This study examines the effect of five factors on the adoption of electronic commerce among small and medium enterprises in Brunei Darussalam. A review of the literature shows that owner characteristics such as lack of perceived relative advantage, lack of knowledge, and perceived lack of trust are significant inhibitors while environment characteristics such as competitive pressure and, government support are significant motivators of electronic commerce in Brunei Darussalam. A questionnaire survey was conducted in 360 small and medium enterprises. A total of 184 valid responses were obtained. Stratified random sampling was adopted over other techniques to enhance representativeness. Data analysis shows that significant relationship exists between each of the five variables and electronic commerce adoption among small and medium enterprises in Brunei Darussalam. This study concludes that the five factors explain more than fifty percent of the variation in small and medium enterprises adoption. Competitive pressure emerged as the most important factor in terms of relative importance. This factor is followed by IT knowledge, relative advantage, security and government support.

Or, les modes d'apprentissages les plus développés dans les formations e-learning en contexte académique relèvent d'une approche pédagogique classique. Dans cet article, nous présentons une méthode d'apprentissage à priori plus appropriée aux adultes, l'andragogie, et étudions sa validité avec les technologies les plus utilisées dans les formations e-learning. Mots clés: E-learning d'entreprise, technologies d'apprentissage, andragogie ABSTRACT IN ENGLISH: Research in e-learning is distinctive in that it has been conducted chiefly in an academic context, whereas the use of educational technologies is proliferating in the business world. Nonetheless, the most highly developed e-learning modes in academia are based on a classical pedagogical approach. This article analyses a learning method--andragogy--that is by definition more appropriate for adults. In addition, the validity of andragogy is assessed through mapping with the most widely used e-learning technologies.

%X Healthcare facilities face limited resources and expanding expenses. Emerging information technologies offer a means for healthcare to measure and control their resources and workflow processes, and ultimately improve patient care. The usefulness of one emerging information technology, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), is examined in a "proof of application" study conducted at a Level-1 trauma unit. Results from the study suggest not only that RFID technology can assist in the measurement and ultimate control of workflow processes, but also that traditional and non-traditional IS practices are necessary for successful RFID implementation. Lessons learned about the idiosyncrasies of RFID implementation and the cleansing and analysis of RFID-generated data are reported.

%X This paper provides a critical review to analyze the promises and important challenges of studying flow, a psychological state, in the computer-mediated environments (CME).  Despite the strong interest in IS, HCI, Marketing, Education, and other research disciplines over more than a decade, adapting the phenomenon of flow to computer users in the literature shows inconsistencies and discrepancies. Few studies attempted to provide a coherent picture of the area. Based on a careful examination of the literature, we identify both conceptual and methodological challenges (operationalization of the constructs and data collection methods) faced when studying flow in computer-mediated environments. Although not all challenges are solved in the literature, we point out directions and possible solutions for many challenges and call for more studies in this promising area.  The paper discusses implications for research in human computing behavior in general and in flow in particular. It cautions researchers to examine hidden assumptions of theories in other disciplines before applying them to address IS issues and concerns.

%X This longitudinal research study investigates the teaching and research expectations for potential IS professors. Most university departments advertise for specific job skills and qualifications when they attempt to recruit faculty members. This study examines over 400 IS placement advertisements for the academic recruiting years 2001-2002, 2002-2003 and 2003-2004. Top teaching and research areas that universities are interested in for their new hires are identified. The study then investigates whether the interests of candidates seeking appointments are similar. Over 400 IS candidate doctorates' résumés are content analyzed and their teaching and research preferences are identified. By looking at the teaching and research needs of the universities and the preferences of IS candidates, it is then possible to identify if a gap exists between the two. Lists of (1) most required and (2) most desired IS teaching and research areas over the three year period are shown. The results report that in terms of teaching, what the universities are looking for is being well matched with what candidates are offering, except in the universities' demand for telecommunications. With respect to research, while there is some match between demand and supply, there is a noticeable lack of  demand by universities for e-Commerce, HCI and ERP.

%X Until recently, investments in information analysis and decision support languished as companies undertook higher priority IT projects with more direct and immediate impact on their bottom lines.  Today, the success of how some companies use information for competitive advantage and operational effectiveness (e.g., Wal-Mart, Dell) is causing business leaders to look more carefully at how well their firms are leveraging information. Furthermore, web technology makes it both technically and financially feasible to deliver literally millions of pages of text to desktops as needed. The technologies available to manage different types of information are also improving rapidly and converging.  Software, while still imperfect, is therefore opening the door to a host of new possibilities for information management and delivery.  These factors are placing new pressures on IT to focus more thoughtfully on the information component of their function. This paper explores how IT's role in information delivery is changing and evolving in organizations. It first surveys the rapidly expanding world of information and technology and why information delivery became so important so rapidly.  Then, it discusses the value proposition of information in organizations.  Next it describes the important components of an effective information delivery function in IT. Finally, it looks at how information delivery will likely evolve over the next five to ten years and what this will mean for IT and organizations.  The paper concludes that information delivery in IT is an idea whose time has finally come. For the first time, senior business executives are ready to hear about the value of information. However, the challenges for IT are huge. Not only does effective information delivery require new technologies, it also means that IT must develop new internal non-technical and analytic capabilities and makes its work much more visible in the organization.

%X Cross-cultural IS research is beginning to mature; however, much is left to do. This article reviews the most popular conceptualization of National Culture and offers suggestions for improvements in measurement. While Hofstedefs culture dimensions  uncertainty avoidance, power distance, masculinity/femininity, and individualism/collectivism  are still widely used in many disciplines; it is not guaranteed that the measures still hold after over 30 years. Empirical evidence is presented from two studies that indicate that shifts might have occurred. Because the usual national culture constructs are measured at the national level, they also should not be used in individual models of behavior or technology acceptance.

%X The introduction of a new network level protocol called Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) represents a significant step forward in the development of the Internet. While IPv6 offers a number of advantages over the current standard (IPv4), its adoption has been inconsistent, often varying by geographic and political region.  Through an investigation of early and late adopters of IPv6, this paper seeks to understand the factors that influence the time of adoption decision. The study was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, we interviewed Internet thought leaders.  Based on previous literature about the characteristics of early and late adopters, and characteristics specific to IPv6 derived from the interviews, we developed a set of initial notions describing the conditions that are likely to encourage early adoption of IPv6. In stage two we tested those conditions through interviews with eight ISPs in six countries. We found that relative advantage, uncertainty and risk, crisis, and power relationships influence an organization's time of adoption while organizational age does not impact the time of adoption. In addition, we found that sponsorship and availability of information indirectly affect time of adoption by mitigating the perceived risk of early adoption.

%X This paper introduces a new concept, the software continuum concept based on the observation that exists a general parallelism between the software continuum from bits to business/Internet ecosystems and the natural continuum from particles to ecosystems. The general parallelism suggests that homeomorphisms may be identified and therefore some concepts, processes, and/or mechanisms in one continuum can be investigated for application in the other continuum. We argue that the homeomorphisms give rise to a biologically-inspired architectural framework for addressing robust control, robust intelligence, and robust autonomy issues in e-business software and other business-IT integration challenges. As application, we examine the mapping of a major enterprise-level architecture framework to the biologically-inspired framework. Design considerations for robust intelligence and autonomy in large-scale software automation and some major systemic features for flexible business-IT integration are also discussed.

%X One of the challenges in teaching information systems analysis and design is setting up experiential learning projects in which students have an opportunity to apply and reinforce the theories and techniques they have acquired in the classroom. This note aims to shed light on this issue and to offer Appreciative Inquiry as an alternative to the prevailing problem solving lens. The Accelerated Systems Analysis and Design with Appreciative Inquiry Workshop revolves around a genuine system design project, which provides an opportunity to apply the latest systems analysis and design methodologies in a realistic setting and to gain hands-on experience in a safe learning environment. Building on the principles of Appreciative Inquiry, the workshop is designed to emphasize collaborative work in the pursuit of both organizational and personal value. The workshop provides not only a framework for looking at organizations and organizational life, but also a language to communicate their dynamic complexities and interdependencies. Overall, participants gain a balanced mix of formal theory, critical thinking, and hands on experience, which prepare them for effective communication and participation in system development in organizational settings.

Systems and network applications vendors are unveiling a wide array of new products designed to assist in this effort and the trade literature is devoting significant coverage to the IT operations processes required to achieve required IT service levels.  Despite increasing industry attention to the importance of IS operations, the authors believe that such concerns are relatively unaddressed in the typical undergraduate business-oriented IS curriculum.  This article describes  a  course currently offered at the authors' university that conceptualizes the enterprise management of IS as including both IS governance and IS management processes.

%X Business students often find it difficult to understand the relevance of the traditional core MIS course taught as part of most business curricula. To address this problem, we made several changes to how we teach IS to business students. One of those changes consists of using cross-course projects that require the application of IS tools and concepts. This article explains one such project that is jointly assigned in an IS course and in a Finance course. In this project, students apply their understanding of financial markets and investments by selecting a set of company stocks that they then manage as a mutual fund. They must build an information system both to track their fund performance and to allow entering of buy and sell transactions. The project is popular among the students, and it reinforces numerous IS concepts and skills.

%X The Global Diffusion of the Internet (GDI) framework is used to examine Internet diffusion in Togo along six dimensions: Pervasiveness, Geographical Dispersion, Sectoral Absorption, Connectivity Infrastructure, Organizational Infrastructure, and Sophistication of Use.  The Internet in Togo originated in the private sector in 1996.  In the years that followed, the Togolese Internet grew at a slower rate than the Internet in many other countries over the same period of time.  After examining how each dimension evolved, this study concludes, amongst many suggestions, that the Togolese government should encourage more telecommunication infrastructure development by allowing private companies to utilize Togo Telecom's network.

%X This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the technical and business implications of adopting Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) in organizational settings. The year 2004 marked a significant shift toward adopting RFID because of mandates by large retailers and government organizations. The use of RFID technology is expected to increase rapidly in the next few years. At present, however, initial barriers against widespread adoption include standards, interoperability, costs, forward compatibility, and lack of familiarity. This paper describes basic components of an RFID system including tags, readers, and antennas and how they work together using an integrated supply chain model. Our analysis suggests that business needs to overcome human resource scarcity, security, legal and financial challenges and make informed decision regarding standards and process reengineering. The technology is not fully mature and suffers from issues of attenuation and interference. A laboratory experiment conducted by the authors' shows that the middleware is not yet at a "plug-and-play" stage, which means that initial adopters need to spend considerable effort to integrate RFID into their existing business processes. Appendices contain a glossary of common RFID terms, a list of RFID vendors and detailed findings of the laboratory experiment.

%X Educating management students in technology-based disciplines can be enhanced through experiential team projects simulating the activities employees perform in actual technology jobs. This paper describes an experiential team project the authors use in the Management Information Systems course at Boston College. The project was developed jointly by Boston College faculty and consultants from the Boston office of a major consulting firm. The project involves student teams playing the roles of IT consultants who must compete against one another to win a consulting engagement at an imaginary company. The company's business situation is communicated to students through a case study written in the format of a Request For Proposal (RFP) informing information technology (IT) vendors that the company is interested in procuring a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. Each student team develops a consulting proposal responding to the RFP and presents the proposal to company managers. The activities involved in identifying the company's business needs, developing a proposal, and determining which team "wins" the contract are simulated through phone calls and live meetings with company managers, who are role-played by consulting firm employees. These real-life business interactions expose students to the ever changing nature of IT, motivate them to improve their technical understanding, and challenge them to improve their communication skills through written deliverables and live business presentations. Student buy-in and response to the project is strong and immediate since they find themselves challenged by complex, relevant business issues.

They were asked to predict the effect that Electronic Commerce technologies and disintermediation and reintermediation would exert on the major firms in the U.S. air travel distribution industry in each of five major market segments.   The panel forecast that major disintermediation and reintermediation would occur and that there would be a sharp reduction in the number of traditional travel agents five and ten years in the future.  The panel also identified a number of strategic threats and opportunities for the channel participants.  This paper compares the panel's predictions to what actually occurred and describes technology-related developments that the panel did not foresee.  In particular, the panel predicted a major reduction in the number of travel agent entities between 1997 and 2002, as well as in 2007.   By the end of 2002, the panel's forecast was very close to what actually occurred.   Our overall conclusion is that the Delphi method worked well as a predictor in this instance.

%X A guiding premise of academic scholarship is that knowledge gained from first-hand research experience is disseminated to students via the classroom.  However, that valuable connection is lost when professors are not researching what they teach.  In this paper, we explore issues of mismatch between teaching and research in the Information Systems (IS) discipline.  Specifically, while systems analysis and design (SA&D) is an integral topic in IS curricula, this topic is the research specialty of few IS professors.  This situation is reflected by the low number of research publications in this area; particularly in the leading mainstream IS journals.  We characterize the gap between teaching and research in SA&D, offer possible explanations for this gap, suggest avenues to better understand and enhance SA&D research via the design science paradigm, list a number of areas in SA&D in which there is ample need and opportunity for high quality research, and show through an example how a research mindset can be incorporated in a graduate level SA&D course.

%X Incorporating a human computer interaction (HCI) perspective into the systems development life cycle (SDLC) is necessary to information systems (IS) success and, in turn, to the success of businesses. However, modern SDLC models are based more on organizational needs than human needs. The human interaction aspect of an information system is usually considered far too little (only the screen interface) and far too late in the IS development process (only at the design stage). Thus, often a gap exists between satisfying organizational needs and supporting and enriching human users. This problem can be addressed by carefully integrating HCI development into the SDLC process to achieve a truly human-centered IS development approach. This paper examines the roles of HCI in systems development, justifies the importance of considering HCI through out the entire systems development life cycle, presents a methodology for human-centered IS development, and demonstrates how to apply this methodology to develop human-centered information systems.

This study reports on data about publication productivity of information systems (IS) researchers from 1999 to 2003. We collected information about IS papers published in twelve IS journals during this period. After classification, the most productive individuals and institutions for this sample are identified. We also compared our findings with past research to demonstrate the changes in publication productivity over time. Publication productivity changes somewhat among researchers and institutions.

%X To protect the information assets of organizations, many different standards and guidelines have been proposed. Among them, International standard ISO 17799 is one of the most prominent international efforts on information security. This standard provides both an authoritative statement on information security and the procedures to be adopted by organizations to ensure information security.  Security professionals claim ISO 17799 to be a suitable model for information security management and an appropriate vehicle for addressing information security management issues in the modern organization.  However, to our knowledge, no empirical studies have been conducted to validate this standard. Based on a survey of information security professionals, we found that ISO 17799 is comprehensive, but not parsimonious.

Specifically, the paper proposes an extension of the influence of perceived user resource, which in turn was developed from the original TAM literature. It is also tied to the Information Technology literature about socio-economic development. Our objective is to shed light on the interactions between socio-economic development needs and factors generally innate to sub-Sahara Africa and other developing countries that impede sustainable technological adoption and diffusion.  We argue that developing countries lag in adopting 'foreign technologies'.  We offer diagnostics and prescriptions for how to effect a sustainable technological adoption to support socio-economic development across Sub-Saharan Africa.  This article should bring into focus this and other developing regions that are almost non-existent in mainstream information systems research.

%X The implementation literature shows that many organizations are able to install enterprise systems (ES), in the sense that they make the system available for use, but failed in their efforts to diffuse and incorporate the system throughout the organization's daily practices. This difficulty is not new. It is wever, the special characteristics of ES re-motivate an enquiry into issues of technological diffusion and the related areas of learning. This research identifies and describes the process and key actions associated with the diffusion of ES. The presentation focuses on two key case studies. The methodology utilizes in-depth case studies for constructing theory from the observed field data. The ES diffusion model presented puts use amidst a network of knowledge flows and learning episodes. This new perspective puts more emphasis on the importance of experiential learning than some accounts and reaffirms the vital role of knowledge creation and sharing. The studies also show how the diffusion of ES throughout the organizations was an iterative, cumulative, and virtuous process over time. Finally, the studies confirm that it is the different dimensions of business adaptation and  system configuration and tailoring, that represent the authentic signature of the ES implementation experience.

%X Given evidence that IT capabilities are linked to business performance, well-defined procedures would be expected to exist for engineering these capabilities to high standards. Surprisingly, this does not appear to be the case. In fact, IT executives freely admit that they may not use standard, verifiable, and repeatable capabilities. To address this situation, the authors formed a group of senior IT managers from leading edge companies to share experiences and insights into how best to identify and implement effective IT capabilities. The result is a 5-step framework for enhancing IT capabilities.

%X The supply and demand of IS professors shifted in the last decade.  Understanding the fluctuation of the IS faculty job market is a critical success factor for future planning and recruitment efforts. This paper presents the results of a longitudinal study that monitored the supply and demand of IS professors between 1992 and 2004.  Data, primarily from the AIS and ICIS placement services, were analyzed to identify the trends in this market.  Other relevant issues such as the composition of IS faculty position applicants, supply of IS doctorates, and trends in IS professor salary are also discussed.  The paper concludes with recommendations to business and IS schools based on the findings.

%X With the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the United States in 2002, and an ever-increasing corporate focus on ensuring prudent returns on technology investments, the notion of IT governance became a major issue for both business practitioners and academics.  Although the term "IT governance" is a relatively new addition to the syntax of academic research, significant previous work is reported on IT decisions rights and IT loci of control, notions that are synonymous with the current understanding of IT governance. This paper presents a literature review for existing research in IT governance.  A framework, named the Conceptual Framework For IT Governance Research is proposed to provide a logical structure for existing research results.  Using this framework, we classify the previous literature on governance into two separate streams that follow parallel paths of advancement.  A popular contemporary notion of IT governance is then presented, together with the argument that this new notion, by implicitly extending both streams of research, represents an initial amalgamation of the two paths of literature.  We conclude that even with the consideration of contemporary structures, academicians and practitioners alike continue to explore the concept of IT governance in an attempt to find appropriate mechanisms to govern corporate IT decisions.

%X The e-Gov field (also called Electronic Government, Digital Government, Electronic Governance, and similar names) emerged in the late 1990´s. Since then it spurred several scientific conferences and journals. Because the field grew considerably in size, both its contents and position with respect to other research fields and disciplines need to be explained and discussed. What is e-Gov? What is e-Gov research? What does it mean for the field of Information Systems? This paper briefly sketches the short e-Gov history and current status, and discusses the content of the field as it appears in current research. We conclude with a discussion of e-Gov as a research field of interest both as a new application area for IS theories and methods and as a source of new insight.

%X Limiting the focus of risk analysis to quantifiable factors and using a narrow understanding of the scope of a software project are major contributors to significant software failures. A Software Development Impact Statement (SoDIS) process is presented which extends the concept of software risk in three ways;  	--it moves beyond the limited approach of schedule, budget, and function,  	--it adds qualitative elements, and  	--it recognizes project stakeholders beyond those considered in typical risk analysis.  	 As the types of risks increase the range of stakeholders that need to be considered also expands. Using this expanded view of risk analysis reduced or eliminated the impacts of many previously undetected risks of software development. The SoDIS process and its software associated development tasks with relevant stakeholders through the application of structured questions.   This process was incorporated effectively into the software development life cycle and applied to software development projects in different domains on several continents. The successes of the SoDIS process provide strong evidence that a significant side-effect of narrowing project objectives is a root cause of IT project failures.

%X Personal web usage can be defined as any voluntary act of employees using their company's web access during office hours to surf non-work related websites for non-work purposes. Previous research suggested that personal web usage is a negative force with productivity losses, congested computer resources, security costs, and the potential risk of legal liability. However, using qualitative research we investigated the attitudes of a diverse set of individuals to personal web usage. Our findings suggest that personal web usage in the workplace can be potentially constructive, although we acknowledge the potential for negative uses as well. We suggest an extension of social contract theory to explain these findings.

%X Now that the number of cellular phone subscribers is over 1.6 billion in the world and over 180 million in the United States, it is an appropriate time to consider Asia, the “new” wireless economy, with respect to mobile telephony. Several major cellular phone service providers chose Korea as a testing ground to assess the effects of third generation (3G) technology and deployment. Several Korean mobile carriers plan to roll-out the world’s first handset-based satellite digital multimedia broadcasting (DMB) services via cellular phones. This letter presents a status report on cellular phone services and applications in Korea. It also describes nine major factors influencing Korea’s status as a leader in mobile cellular phone and services. An important influence is the younger generation of cellular phone users in Japan and Korea who associate the cellular phone trend with their social status.

%X The nature and quality of a firm's dialogue with its customers is a core capability. Few firms are able to manage this dialogue effectively and use what they know to add more value for customers and ultimately improve firm performance. Knowledge management (KM) functions are therefore being asked how their expertise can help companies do a better job in this area. This paper examines the wide variety of ways organizations use KM in their customer relationships. It begins with an examination of the need for Customer Knowledge Management (CKM) and how it differs from Customer Relationship Management (CRM). It then looks at the four different dimensions of customer knowledge and at some of the innovative ways companies use them to add value for their customers. It next discusses the key organizational challenges of implementing CKM. The paper concludes with some best practices and advice about how to implement a program of CKM successfully in an organization. It suggests that CKM is not a tool like CRM but a process that is designed to dynamically capture, create and integrate knowledge about and for customers.

%X Existing literature on IT standards focuses on the role of technical factors such as network effects and competitive behavior on the creation of standards.  However, the role of users and vendors in initiating the standards definition and ratification process is less well understood. Given the advantages associated with standards, all users and vendors of IT products would be expected to be glad to participate in the standards definition and ratification process. However, if that were the case, many fewer proprietary technologies would compete. This paper explains qualitatively why users, vendors, and government bodies choose (or don't choose) to participate in the standards definition and ratification process. A better understanding of their motivations for participating or not in the process should help to attract more participants to the process. The paper concludes by analyzing strategies to recover the cost of standards definition and ratification process, and their impact on the standards adoption rate.

%X Virtual forms of organization, including outsourcing, are expected to bring broad, structural transformations to American business. Yet, little is known about the formal response of U.S. Business Schools to the boundary-spanning challenges that virtual organization presents. In this study, key elements of Adaptive Structuration Theory (AST) are utilized as a means to investigate the effects of virtual organization on academic disciplines. Results of a survey of 471 Business School faculty members, including 63 Information Systems faculty, on the role of virtual organization in academic curricula are analyzed in the terms defined by the AST framework. Results indicate significant variation by discipline, concept area, and appropriation of the concepts related to virtual organization. Implications for Information Science include the need for establishing academic leadership as well as attending to perceived limitations in virtual organization tools and technologies.  In addition, the results have implications for the ongoing dialogue on the role of Information Science and related academic disciplines.

%X Renewable course projects (i.e. projects whose lives extend beyond the end of an academic semester) provide an effective alternative to class assignments that require repetition of artificial tasks typical in many information systems and technology-related courses. Though these "throwaway" projects are certainly meritorious, renewable projects enable students to engage in real-world development paradigms, such as modularization and life cycles, to develop lasting systems that solve relevant problems. By embracing the full project life cycle, modularization of work, and open source software renewable projects expose students to traditional aspects of classroom development and also to the more real world features of the project cycle. Two case studies provide experiential evidence of the success of renewable projects.

This influence is expressed in a bias in how research is conducted and published and how practice is conducted. The bias is usually in favour of the dominant cultural perspective. The effects of these biases, both positive and negative, are discussed and possible solutions discussed.

%X Although systems development research is at the core of the Information Systems discipline, some scholars call attention to a teaching and research gap in this area of IS.  In this study, we examine the state of systems development research in IS by analyzing the articles published in three leading journals between 2000 and 2004. We propose a classification framework based on the type of research paradigm (design vs. explanatory) and the nature of the IT-artifact (conceptualization vs. instantiation).  Our results show that about 20% of the articles published in this five year period are focused on systems development. In two of the three journals, there are comparable proportions of studies in the design research and in the explanatory paradigm. However, in all three publications most of the articles are focused on conceptual IT-artifacts, as opposed to algorithms or software-based artifacts. These findings are important for system development researchers when they choose journals where to send their papers.

This paper describes a theoretically driven action research study that delivers a technology-mediated solution for specifying, organizing, representing and using elements of meaning in a body of knowledge. The theoretical basis, 'ontological specification' is of particular interest to IS professionals, particularly those involved in analysis and design, because it guides the efficient transformation of tacit knowledge into an explicit form. The technology-mediated solution influenced by ontological specification was validated through an iterative prototyping form of action research. Users reported that the system was useful in their work, easy to use, and compatible with collaborative work when using it for content analysis in academic research.

%X Concern about information privacy is considered one of the most important issues in e-commerce. To deal with this concern in the context of self-regulation, e-commerce web sites have implemented measures such as posting privacy policies and displaying third party seals. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of the level at which a web site addresses privacy has on the users' perceptions and behavioral intentions during the initial interaction with the web site. A research model is presented and empirically tested by means of an experiment. The study showed that web vendors' interventions had an overall effect on the user perceptions of information privacy in the site. However, having more privacy elements in the web site did not increase the favorable perceptions of the web site. The research model also incorporated other privacy related constructs such as general concern about online privacy and type of information.

%X The center of the IS field is presented as a market of ideas, an intellectual exchange related to the design and management of information technologies in organized human enterprise. In this view, the IS field is a loosely coupled system operating through weak social ties across intellectual communities. A loosely coupled system can operate towards contradictory goals of both plasticity and stability in the search for new research opportunities and generation of valid knowledge.  The market of ideas allows reconciliation of rigor and relevance, technical and social, design and explanation.  It lowers the barriers of established disciplinary regimes and institutions, and facilitates scholarship in fields where conditions change quickly. It helps to balance exploration and exploitation in an effort to avoid competency traps.  Limitations of the metaphor are considered.

Many countries and regions have followed with similar legislation. In this tutorial we present an analysis of the prior work on error prevention and detection in spreadsheets as it relates to SOX and IT governance frameworks, more generally. SOX requires publicly traded companies to address the problem of spreadsheet management and to assume some accountability for generating accurate information from spreadsheets for financial reporting. We attempt to reconcile requirements for SOX with IT spreadsheet research. Gaps in design and implementation of spreadsheet controls are identified.  From our review of prior work on spreadsheets, we offer a series of options for controlling the spreadsheet development process. Finally, we provide suggestions to help IT practitioners in organizations look beyond SOX regulations at governance of end-user developed content.

%X New Public Management (NPM) is a set of private sector management principles which have had a significant impact in the shaping of policy reform agendas in many governments. This article seeks to understand the influence of NPM in a public management reform context and explore the resulting practical and theoretical implications of NPM for e-government. In doing so, this article develops a benefits framework in order to analyse the extent to which NPM has contributed to the attainment of e-government goals. Two case studies are presented detailing the implementation of e-government initiatives in Ireland. Each case provides a differing perspective on the influence of the modernisation agenda in Ireland and the attainment of e-government benefits. Finally, the study provides insightful discussion on the impact of NPM reform initiatives on the success of e-government and the inherent organisational and social challenges.

%X Enterprise architecture is concerned with the fundamental organization of the operating environment of an enterprise. The enterprise architecture is used to plan and control the construction of the systems that populate the operating environment. As the scope covered can be considerable in large enterprises, introducing domain architectures to partition and detail the enterprise architecture is a plausible approach. We formulate prescriptive criteria that consistent domain architectures must meet. By integrating the creation of domain architectures into an extended strategic alignment model we develop a theory that accounts for both the creation, scope-setting and detailing. Based on the creation viewpoint we derive a multi-level classification taxonomy. The primary differentiator is that between domains that are created from business usage viewpoints and those that are created from solution construction viewpoints. Four cases of domain architectures from actual practice are described that illustrate the variety encountered. Domain classifications in all cases conform to the theoretical model. The criteria, the developed theory and the cases have both academic relevance as well as significance for practitioners.

%X The question of why so many developers dedicate time and effort into contributing to Open Source Projects (OSP) is one of the most intriguing questions in OS research. Several preliminary studies have theorized about and empirically examined this challenging question. They suggest a variety of reasons to explain this phenomenon but mostly rely on self-determination theory, with its extrinsic-intrinsic dichotomy, to explain the heterogeneous and complex nature of motivation in OSS. This article provides an alternative, theory-driven approach, whereby three different, yet complementary, theories of motivation are combined, to explain the participation and outcomes of developers in OSP. More specifically, our multi-theoretical framework is based on social exchange theory, goal-orientation, and expectancy theory. An empirical test of the model is provided within the context of SourceForge.net. The results offer new theoretical and practical insights into developers’ motivation and how it affects their participation and outcomes.

%X Firms from emerging economies are rapidly becoming formidable competitors to established industry leaders from developed economies. Aside from anecdotal reports, there is little scholarly evidence concerning the operational details of how emerging economy firms are becoming competitive with developed economy firms. This article addresses the gap by building on the International Business, Strategy and Information Systems literature, and through an empirical analysis of original survey data for 468 firms across ten countries. We develop three primary empirical findings. First, despite the differences between emerging economy firms and developed economy firms, we find that emerging economy/high internationalization firms use marketing- and supply chain-oriented Internet business practices with about the same frequency as developed economy/high internationalization firms. Second, we find that emerging economy/high internationalization firms are more driven than developed economy/high internationalization firms to use Internet business practices to expand existing markets and enter new markets. Third, we find that emerging economy/high internationalization firms report relatively higher sales and customer service impacts from Internet business practices than do developed economy/ high internationalization firms. These findings suggest that emerging economy firms have used the Internet as a resource to position themselves as credible competitors to developed economy firms.

%X The pervasive integration of digital technology into cities provides new opportunities for information systems scholars to participate in the efforts in transforming urban life. It requires (a) the creation of a large-scale digital infrastructure, (b) the design of new services and applications, and (c) the re-examination of the meaning of social interactions in public and private spaces. In order to create an initial forum for multi-disciplinary dialogue to explore these issues, a research workshop was organized by the Irwin L. Gross Institute for Business and Information Technology, Temple University on November 1–3, 2007. This special section includes three papers from the workshop. These three articles point out that the future socio-technical reality of digital urban environments must be deliberately designed in order to magnifies the strengths of the most daring human design endeavor ever—cities.

This perspective contrasts with the approach of investigating how inherent limitations of collaborative technology can be ameliorated. This article describes recent design work addressing the challenge of supporting activity awareness in new ways with social computing technologies.

%X In his landmark essay The Metropolis and Mental Life, Georg Simmel drew the distinction between two “different, yet corresponding” aspects of modernity, which become embodied in the metropolis “as one of those great historical formations in which opposing streams which enclose life unfold, as well as join one another with equal right.” Raymond Williams termed these individuality, which “stresses both a unique person and his (indivisible) membership of a group,” and individualism, “a theory not only of abstract individuals but of the primacy of individual states and interests,” the former being something that diminishes in the metropolis, while the latter is intensified. With the emergence of “digital life,” including new spheres of virtual interaction, these forces take on new forms and characteristics which need to be articulated and understood more widely if plans for the ‘digital city’ and ‘urban transformation’ are to be open, accessible, and generally beneficial. In what follows Simmel’s insights are developed with consideration of work by Williams, Zygmunt Bauman, Erving Goffman, and Richard Sennett, leading to an outline of the paradoxical, ambivalent, and complex nature of the digital metropolis.

%X The increased deployment of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) applications creates application integration challenges. However, very few articles focus on application integration success. That is why we first analyze these contributions and derive success factor candidates (SFCs). In addition, contributions dealing with problems and risks of application integration and related research fields are examined—as they allow for the derivation of further SFCs. In total twenty-six SFCs are collected. A factor analysis is conducted to examine interrelations between SFCs. It yields seven success factor groups, e.g., architecture management, IT/business alignment, or use of methods. In a second step, an exploratory analysis is conducted to examine the impact of these SFCs on various success indicators of application integration. These success indicators were defined beforehand by analyzing theories for information system (IS) success. As a result of the exploratory analysis, twenty-seven hypotheses are proposed. These hypotheses need to be corroborated in a future confirmatory study.

Drawing on a typology of e-consultations and online patient fora, we provide and discuss a number of scenarios of the financial and managerial impacts of the uptake of e-consultations for the period 2009–2013. The study is based on quantitative data from the national statistics database for the period 2003–2008, and qualitative data from interviews with key actors in the Danish national healthcare system. Findings indicate that the digitalization of consultations and the lack of substitution between e-consultations and physical and phone doctor consultations leads to increases in total costs, not reductions. The results call for further research on the emerging adoption of user-centered platforms, such as Web 2.0 applications, in the healthcare area.

%X In response to the growing proliferation of Business Process Management (BPM) in industry and the demand this creates for BPM expertise, universities across the globe are at various stages of incorporating knowledge and skills in their teaching offerings. However, there are still only a handful of institutions that offer specialized education in BPM in a systematic and in-depth manner. This article is based on a global educators’ panel discussion held at the 2009 European Conference on Information Systems in Verona, Italy. The article presents the BPM programs  of five universities from Australia, Europe, Africa, and North America, describing the BPM content covered, program and course structures, and challenges and lessons learned. The article also provides a comparative content analysis of BPM education programs illustrating a heterogeneous view of BPM. The examples presented demonstrate how different courses and programs can be developed to meet the educational goals of a university department, program, or school. This article contributes insights on how best to continuously sustain and reshape BPM education to ensure it remains dynamic, responsive, and sustainable in light of the evolving and ever-changing marketplace demands for BPM expertise.

%X Global Internet usage has fueled much of the technological innovation seen during the first decade of the twenty-first century. Unsurprisingly, this has led to a commensurate increase in consumption of bandwidth, the measure of how much information the Internet can transmit. However, bandwidth is not an inexhaustible resource. Wired communications require physical infrastructure, requiring considerable investment and construction to expand, and wireless communications require sections of electromagnetic spectrum, which has grown much more crowded. This article examines the current bandwidth situation in light of networking trends and events as of 2010. Findings indicate that, although there is no immediate bandwidth crisis, one may eventually come, especially in the wireless spectrum, and, although technological innovation may provide a considerable hedge against the crippling impli-cations of such a shortage, care must be taken to manage growth in bandwidth usage to maintain it at acceptable levels while accounting for the needs of all concerned parties.

A total of 532 management professionals were placed into one of four survey-based scenarios in which they were asked to select a medium for use in a well-defined deceptive task. The scenarios manipulated the familiarity the subject had with the deception target (i.e., colleague or stranger) and the importance of the problem (i.e., minor cost variance versus serious mistake). Results indicate a clear preference for face-to-face communication for deception across all four scenarios. Ten factors were identified that motivated these media selection decisions.

%X As motivations of Information Technology (IT) outsourcing are evolving from a primary focus on cost reduction to an emerging emphasis on improving business performance, it is imperative for organizations to align their outsourcing strategy with their business strategy in order to reap better outsourcing benefits and firm performance. Accordingly, a critical challenge facing organizations is how to effectively organize and manage a well-planned outsourcing strategy in accordance with the direction of a business strategy. With the premise that organizations with the fit between business strategy (i.e., defenders, prospectors, and analyzers) and outsourcing strategy (i.e., independent, arm's length, and embedded strategies) are expected to have better outsourcing benefits and organizational performance than those without such fit, this study seeks to answer the following questions: First, are certain outsourcing strategies more effective than others in particular business strategies?; Second, do their effective alignments positively affect outsourcing benefits and firm performance? To answer these questions, we hypothesize three theoretical feasible sets of internally congruent patterns between business strategy and outsourcing strategy which lead to a greater achievement of outsourcing benefits and firm performance as compared with misfit patterns between them. Empirical data gathered from 136 organizations in Korea that have outsourced their IT functions to external service providers are analyzed. The empirical evidence shows that outsourcing alignment with business strategy significantly influences the outsourcing success and firm performance of defenders, analyzers, and prospectors. The findings have significant implications for further research and practice.

%X Findings in an IT workforce study support the emphasis of business content espoused by IS curriculum guidelines.  Business domain and project management skills are critical to keep in house while technical skills were cited as the top skills sourced.  Paradoxically, technical skills are those cited for entry-level positions. We discuss the issues raised by these findings and recommend several approaches for IS programs to consider.  IS programs must offer a functionally integrated curriculum and deliver it in an experiential business context.  We provide several examples of innovative pedagogical approaches and industry alliances which demonstrate mechanisms to provide students with a stronger business orientation in applying IT.  We recommend a more proactive approach to enrollment including better promotion of IS programs.

%X Nurse clinicians need to make complex decisions on a continual basis, while delivering cost-effective treatments. The rapid proliferation of medical and nursing knowledge complicates the decision-making process, particularly for novice nurses. We describe a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) for the novice nurse that combines evidence-based nursing knowledge with specific patient information to create a real-time guide through the nursing diagnostic care process. The goal of the paper is to describe how an appropriately designed and evidence-based CDSS can aid the nursing practice. An off-the-shelf handheld computer is utilized to deliver clinical knowledge to the nurse, via wireless link to a central server and a data repository. In describing the software architecture of the system, particular emphasis is paid to the issue of appropriate design by discussing the steps taken to address system extensibility, performance, reliability, and security, which are important factors in the design of a CDSS.

All of these share high degree of community formation, user level content creation, and computing, and a variety of other characteristics. We provide an overview of social computing and identify salient characteristics. We argue that social computing holds tremendous disruptive potential in the business world and can significantly impact society, and outline possible changes in organized human action that could be brought about. Social computing can also have deleterious effects associated with it, including security issues. We suggest that social computing should be a priority for researchers and business leaders and illustrate the fundamental shifts in communication, computing, collaboration, and commerce brought about by this trend.

%X Assigning effective teachers to introductory IS courses represents one intervention strategy that has been broadly advocated to help reverse the sharp decline in students majoring in Information Systems (IS). Using a survey of 305 students enrolled in a multiple-section introductory IS course, this study empirically confirms that students who are taught by effective teachers are more likely to be attracted to the IS discipline. Moreover, based on a robust theoretical foundation grounded in Social Cognitive Theory, the findings reveal the underlying mechanisms through which teaching effectiveness influences students' aspirations to pursue an IS degree. Specifically, teaching effectiveness bolsters students' confidence in their ability to successfully perform as IS majors (i.e., self-efficacy), raises students' expectations that valued rewards will be received by majoring in IS (i.e., outcome expectations), and helps students develop enduring interest in the IS field. In addition to teaching effectiveness, students with high self-efficacy and robust outcome expectations become more interested in IS. In turn, interest serves as the primary channel through which goals to choose the IS major develop. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

%X Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSS), which support spatial analysis and decision making, are currently receiving much attention.  Research on SDSS originated from two distinct sources, namely, the GIS community and the DSS community.  The synergy between these two research groups has lead to the adoption of state of the art technical solutions and the development of sophisticated SDSS that satisfy the needs of geographers and top-level decision makers. Recently, the Web has added a new dimension to SDSS and Web-based SDSS (WebSDSS) that are being developed in a number of application domains. This article provides an overview of the emergence of SDSS, its architecture and applications, and discusses some of the enabling technologies and research challenges for future SDSS development and deployment.

%X Users often use application software because of particular features. However, little remains known on whether user perceptions of application use is merely feature-driven or whether users perceive their application use as being more than an amalgamation of  features. As the software industry ushers trends such as Web services, it becomes evermore important for vendors and users alike to clarify how users perceive features and applications. The paper is an attempt to confirm whether users can perceptively unbundle application software features from the overall applications themselves. Using a modified version of the repertory grid technique, this study investigates user perceptions of application features using data collected from users in the design and development departments across five firms. The results suggest that user perceptions of overall applications overshadow their perceptions of independent features, suggesting application-level lock-in effects and pointing out the difficulty in vendor attempts to unbundle features from feature categories and applications. The study closes with a discussion of the findings and offering cues for future research.

%X How do CIOs decide which technologies to acquire and deploy?  This paper presents a set of criteria used by CIOs to vet technology decisions and spread their technology bets.  There is insight to be gained by defining, understanding, and applying these criteria.  In fact, the more we understand the technology due diligence process the better our understanding of technology leverage becomes.  Ultimately, the practice of solid due diligence processes is about the optimization of business technology.    There are at least 15 criteria used by Chief Information Officers (CIOs) to perform due diligence on prospective technology investments.  This paper describes these criteria and prescribes how they should be applied to technology investment decisions.  CIOs benefit from a disciplined due diligence process; technology vendors also benefit since investment decision-making becomes repeatable and predictable - and therefore more manageable; and those who analyze technology decision-making benefit from disciplined due diligence which enables a systematic analysis of the drivers of technology acquisition and deployment, as well as the development of due diligence effectiveness metrics.

In this paper we attempt to motivate and organize IS research endeavors in the nonprofit context. We argue that the nonprofit sector presents not only new challenges but also numerous opportunities for IS research. We present a conceptual framework on the effectiveness of IS in nonprofits and illustrate how the framework can be used to identify the challenges and the opportunities. We also discuss how IS research in nonprofits can contribute to new understandings in IS in all organizations. Overall, we call for an increase in research efforts that will help better understand IS-related issues in the nonprofit sector.

However, we also see organizations struggle in practice to demonstrate such benefits. Conventional thinking suggests that individual organizations can improve their performance in this area through better financial analysis of opportunities. But does this characterization of the solution reflect the real problem? Is there more value that can be achieved through IT at a macro level or are we simply seeing market competition with winners and losers? And will better understanding of the detailed financial consequences of IT systems enable businesses to improve decisions and achieve greater returns? This 2009 ICIS panel session reflected on the literature on IT value over the last thirty years, the future direction of research and the relationship between research and the needs of business in this area.

%X There are different interpretations of which core values e-government build on and promote. Some scholars see e-government as a direct follower to New Public Management (NPM), and as such supporting and promoting values and principles from the business sector. Others see e-government as a promoter of bureaucratic values supporting and promoting the values of traditional weberian ideal bureaucracy. The main issue in this paper is management strategy for public administration. Three examples of such management strategies are examined and compared: traditional bureaucracy, New Public Management and e-government. When investigating these strategies it is necessary to distinguish between strategy as idea and strategy in action. Core values of the management strategies are reconstructed and used as a lens through which a case study of e-government is analyzed. The implemented e-government-solution comprise values from both NPM and bureaucracy. Neither bureaucracy nor NPM alone supply the core values for e-government as a practical management strategy. The paper concludes with a dialectical structure where Bureaucracy is the thesis, NPM the anti-thesis and e-government the practical synthesis.

%X With a new wave of demand for information technology (IT) staff, it is time for the IT community to discover what competencies are needed for IT workers in the new millennium. Most organizations have outsourced their IT projects to low-cost centers in developing countries, and this has changed expectations about local workers—organizations need, and expect, to employ highly skilled IT professionals. This article draws on the competency model to explore what competencies are needed to successfully equip the IT workforce. This research uses the example of IT architects to illustrate how to use the competency model to identify important sets of competencies. We interview professional architects, analyze the content of the discussions and derive a list of fourteen competency attributes important to IT architects. Some competencies are easy to develop, others are difficult to change, and this has implications for university education and industry hiring. This article also discusses the general use of competency models for IT workforce training and selection.

%X The business models of major Web search engines depend on online advertising, primarily in the form of keyword advertising. In recent years, a controversy has gained notoriety worldwide, in both the international court systems and the media. It concerns a form of potential “bait and switch” advertising where a consumer, searching using the brand name of one company, is presented with an advertisement by a competitor of the searched-for brand. We refer to this practice as “piggybacking.” In the U.S. in particular, the legality of this practice, and the potential liability of the search engines for contributing to trademark infringement, is unclear. However, the eventual resolutions of the issue could significantly and negatively impact the business model of Internet search engines. In this paper, we investigate the actual prevalence of piggybacking of major brands in U.S. search engines. We submitted 100 search queries consisting of top global brand names to three major search engines. Analysis of 2,350 advertisements from search engine results pages showed that just 4 percent were triggered by competitors’ trademarked terms. There was even lower use of those trademark terms in the ad text. Thus, overall competitive piggybacking does not appear to be a deceptive or widespread phenomenon. Implications for this are discussed, and suggestions for future research are presented.

%X Enabled by the globalization and advances in technology, offshore outsourcing of software development to countries such as India, China, and Russia, continues to increase. Much of the extant research has not focused on the communication practices observed in thriving offshore client−vendor relationships. Our research identifies communication practices found in a case study of a large multinational client’s multi-vendor relationship in offshore outsourcing of software testing projects. We discuss the empirically grounded communication practices in the light of existing literature to highlight how the client−vendor relationships deliver long-term value. Through this discussion, we delineate and discuss communication techniques. Implications for theory and practice are also discussed.

%X Information Systems research often uses article citation counts to judge the impact of articles, journals, and authors, and even to assess the maturity of the discipline. Yet little is known about the drivers of article impact. Motivated by the continued debate on the importance of theory development, methodological rigor, and tradeoffs between rigor and relevance, the authors of this paper examine the structure of theory-based empirical IS articles as a potential determinant of their scientific impact. Using the straightforward measure of page counts, the authors assess the structure of these articles at the macro level and develop hypotheses on article impact. Results indicated that, as hypothesized, the structure of IS articles does determine their impact. Conceptualization and theory development in articles tends to payoff in citation counts, while emphasis on methodology and implications does not. They discuss recommendations for review systems and for authors, as well as for the field as a whole. Supplemental analyses show that highly-influential IS research tends to be theory-based empirical and that, consistent with the evolution of the field, concept to method ratio has been going up in IS articles over time; a synchronization that has paid off in terms of impact.

%X While public awareness of environmental sustainability is growing, there is concern about the economic costs of shifting to a greener economy. In the case of climate change, a critical issue is the relationship of economic output to greenhouse gas emissions, which has been labeled carbon productivity. Increasing carbon productivity means that economic growth can be sustained while emissions are reduced. Information technology has great potential to enhance carbon productivity, as IT is used to increase the energy efficiency of buildings, transportation systems, supply chains and electrical grids. On the other hand, the production and use of computers is a fast-growing component of global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, a fact that must be balanced against the benefits of IT use. Green IS refers to the use of information systems to achieve environmental objectives, while Green IT emphasizes reducing the environmental impacts of IT production and use. This article focuses primarily on Green IS. It reviews existing Green IS research, presents a model of IT investment and carbon productivity, and lays out suggestions for future research.

Our study augments the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model [Venkatesh et al., 2003] with measures of prior IT use frequency and habit strength. We find these two factors provide distinct predictions which explain most of the effects that occur within the model under sporadic use conditions.

%X One of the most important skills all IT staff need to develop today is how to communicate effectively with business. Over and over, research has shown that if IT and business cannot speak the same language, focus on the same issues and communicate constructively, they cannot build a trusting relationship. And business is consistently more negative about IT’s ability to communicate effectively than IT is. In fact, even while IT collaboration is improving, business’s assessment of IT’s communication skills is declining. While much attention has been paid to organizational alignment between IT and business (e.g., governance, structure) very little has been paid to the nature and impact of the social dimension of alignment, a big element of which involves communication. To explore the business and interpersonal competencies that IT staff will need in order to do their jobs effectively over the next five–seven years and what companies should be doing to help develop them, the authors convened a focus group of senior IT managers from a variety of different organizations. This paper documents the results of this discussion, integrating them with findings from the research and practitioner literature. It begins by characterizing the state of communication in the business–IT relationship and why “good communication” is becoming increasingly important. Then, it explores what is meant by “good communication” in this relationship and looks at some of the inhibitors of effective communication between these groups. Finally, it discusses the key communication skills that need to be developed by IT staff and makes recommendations for how organizations can improve or develop communication in the business–IT relationship. It concludes that good communication has both social and organizational dimensions, both of which need to be appropriately managed. It also shows that there is a “virtuous circle” of communication, with is associated with improved IT performance and perceptions of IT value.

%X In 1993 Couger et al. stated in an MIS Quarterly article on creativity in information systems (IS) organizations that the topic of creativity is under-researched in the IS discipline. Is the subject of creativity—despite its undisputable importance for individuals, organizations, and societies—still a neglected area in IS research? In what contexts, with what methods, and with what results have IS researchers studied the phenomenon of creativity? And what creativity-related themes warrant further investigation? In this article we analyze, based on six analytical dimensions, IS studies on creativity published in the eight top-ranked IS journals as recommended by the Association for Information Systems. The analysis provides a detailed picture of how the concept of creativity has been treated in our discipline’s arguably most influential publication outlets. It becomes apparent that IS researchers have been predominantly employing a rather limited number of research designs aiming at a rather limited number of creativity-related topics. Grounded in our analysis, we discuss the prospects of creativity research in the IS discipline and provide a future research agenda. In doing so, we propose three main research themes that can meaningfully contribute to our discipline.

In particular, this article offers initial answers to a set of research questions which are important for the foundations of NeuroIS, an emerging subfield within the IS discipline. The key questions discussed during the retreat that are addressed in this article are: (1) What is NeuroIS, and how does it relate to sister disciplines, such as neuroscience, neuroeconomics, and neuromarketing? (2) Which neuroscience tools are relevant for IS research? (3) What can IS researchers learn from the neuroscience literature, and what do we already know about brain activity? (4) What are possible IS research topics that can be examined with neuroscience tools, and what are some promising research areas for NeuroIS? (5) How can NeuroIS be established as a new subfield in the IS literature, and what are the current challenges for NeuroIS? The article concludes by offering the participants’ outlook on the future of NeuroIS.

%X Given declining management information systems (MIS) enrollments at our university, we seek to understand our students’ selection of a major. Prior studies have found that students choose a major based on a number of factors, with subject matter interest consistently being most important. We contribute to the literature by developing a deeper understanding of what is meant by subject matter interest, which we refer to as smiFactors, for MIS as a major and career. Based on a qualitative analysis of open-ended survey questions completed by undergraduate business students, we confirm a number of smiFactors for MIS gleaned from recent studies and identify three new ones. We also relate our findings to broad categories of vocational interests. Of the newly identified smiFactors, one—linking business and technology—is unique to MIS, whereas the other two—practical application of course work and daily variety—apply to MIS as well as other majors and careers. Our findings provide a more complete foundation for helping students make an informed choice of MIS as a major. We use our findings and an extension of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to identify four types of intervention for increasing MIS enrollments.

We integrate this categorization with previous research in mobile commerce and e-business in order to provide the most comprehensive categorization to date. Using this categorization, we next investigate trends in the discussion and research on mobile computing. From these trends, we develop a comprehensive framework that addresses both where mobile computing research has been over the past ten years, but also areas of opportunity for future research. Results indicate research is required in the areas of: (a) IT value stream proposition (both within and outside the firm), (b) human-computer interaction (designing usable mobile computing systems), (c) legal/ethical issues surrounding mobile computing-enabled activities, and (d) organizational/societal impact and change precipitated by mobile computing technologies.

%X This study investigates how social capital is built and maintained in a Hybrid Virtual Communities (HVC), that is, a group of people with shared interests who meet face-to-face to exchange information and knowledge or provide emotional support  and also do so in a “virtual” or online environment. Past health-IS research has primarily focused on pure virtual environments; however, many communities entail face-to-face interactions as well. This research helps fill this void. Discourse analysis of virtual interactions, face-to-face (FTF) observations, and semi-structured interviews of a patient-oriented HVC were analyzed, providing rich descriptive data. Using the theoretical foundation of social capital, this article extends existing theory by combining Drentea and Moren-Cross’s [2005] social support framework with Etzioni and Etzioni’s [1999] aspects of community framework to better explain building and maintaining social capital  in a HVC.

%X A growing number of employers provide electronic personal health records (PHRs) as a service to employees as part of a health benefit program. However, a variety of unique issues related to attitudes and adoption arise when a PHR is hosted by the employer, and little research has addressed this relationship. This article reports the findings from an exploratory study of factors that influence employee perceptions, concerns, and expectations related to an employer—sponsored PHR service, with data from 132 employees of a large U.S. corporation. Attitudes toward PHR systems and employee perceptions and concerns identified in prior research are evaluated. Despite studies suggesting significant demand for PHR products across the general public, especially those that are offered at no cost to the user, responses indicated unique barriers to use, as well as opportunities, for employer-sponsored PHRs. The future role of employers as sponsors of PHRs is discussed in light of obstacles and strategies to improve system use, and the need to help employees realize the potential value of employer-sponsored PHRs.

%X Despite a growing stream of research into the use of computer-mediated communication (CMC) media in higher education, there remains limited understanding about the students’ motivations for using CMC alongside non-CMC media within a learning context. This article identifies seven dimensions of motivation from the perspective of uses and gratifications (U&G), including information seeking, convenience, connectivity, problem solving, content management, social presence, and social context cues. It was found that each CMC satisfied different motivations for its use, and that overall CMC best fulfilled information seeking, convenience, connectivity, and content management motivations. This study also identifies a number of similarities and differences between CMC and non-CMC media in terms of the motivations for their use. Finally, the study concludes with a discussion of the implications for Information Systems (IS) researchers, higher education, and organizations.

%X The study of factors that influence intentions to use information technology enabled innovations enjoys a long tradition in the information systems literature. Recently there have been calls for research that enhances our understanding of interrelationships among beliefs related to technology adoption. In addition, there has been recent interest in more closely examining specific beliefs, including perceived compatibility. In this study we use the context of distance learning to develop and test a model of use intentions. Our main focus is on two under-researched forces that may influence intentions, pressure and fit. Pressure pertains to the normative and institutional influences to engage in distance learning. Specifically, we examine how perceptions of subjective norm and voluntariness influence distance learning intentions. Compatibility concerns how well distance learning matches with the desires and past experiences of potential distance learners. We use Karahanna, Agarwal and Angst’s [2006] multi-dimensional conceptualization of compatibility to represent compatibility beliefs. We examine both the direct and indirect impact of these factors on distance learning intentions in a nomological network that includes other beliefs (relative advantage and ease of use) drawn from diffusion theory. Data from a survey indicate that compatibility with preferred work style and values have an impact on intentions, as do voluntariness beliefs. This study points out the importance of using a multidimensional view of compatibility. In addition, results related to voluntariness indicate that in largely volitional environments institutional pressures to adopt may actually lower use intentions.

%X Creative processes, for instance, the development of visual effects or computer games, increasingly become part of the agenda of information systems researchers and practitioners. Such processes get their managerial challenges from the fact that they comprise both well-structured, transactional parts and creative parts. The latter can often not be precisely specified in terms of control flow, required resources, and outcome. The processes’ high uncertainty sets boundaries for the application of traditional business process management concepts, such as process automation, process modeling, process performance measurement, and risk management. Organizations must thus exercise caution when it comes to managing creative processes and supporting these with information technology. This, in turn, requires a profound understanding of the concept of creativity in business processes. In response to this, the present article introduces a framework for conceptualizing creativity within business processes. The conceptual framework describes three types of uncertainty and constraints as well as the interrelationships among these. The study is grounded in the findings from three case studies that were conducted in the film and visual effects industry. Moreover, we provide initial evidence for the framework’s validity beyond this narrow focus. The framework is intended to serve as a sensitizing device that can guide further information systems research on creativity-related phenomena.

%X In the year 2004 Portale Sardegna, an Italian online tour operator, launched a new product, Open Voucher (OV), with the bold objective of prolonging the tourist season on the island. The idea was conceptually simple: to create a Sardinian tourist product capable of attracting travelers to the island during the low season, while the implementation was quite difficult. Open Voucher attempted this de-seasonalization through the development of an Internet-enabled network of affiliated hotels providing availability of rooms year round and offering their product through the Open Voucher platform at a low, fixed rate. In the years ranging from 2004 to 2006, Open Voucher showed good traction in the marketplace, but in 2007 it began to record falling bookings and deteriorating results. What was happening? Had the leadership team defined the strategy to launch Open Voucher properly? Was it even possible to re-launch the Open Voucher product?

%X IS offshoring has become one of the most discussed phenomena in IS research and practice. Particularly due to its rapid evolvement, current research on IS offshoring lacks a consolidated view on existing results. The article at hand seeks to meet this need by systematically reviewing and analyzing prior academic literature on IS offshoring. Based on a review of top-ranked IS and management journals as well as IS conference proceedings, we compile an exhaustive bibliography of ninety-six publications solely focusing on IS offshoring from a (project) management perspective. To adequately address the immense diversity of these publications, a multi-perspective research framework consisting of three perspectives, namely, research focus, research approach, and reference theory, is introduced and forms the basis for our literature analysis. The analysis results confirm the appropriateness of our framework and reveal directions for future research along the framework perspectives: Most importantly, in an effort to increase the significance and the trustworthiness of their results, researchers should apply a more theory-driven approach and provide a better description of their research context. Moreover, future research needs to pay particular attention to the pre-implementation stages of an IS offshoring initiative as well as the special nature of nearshoring and captive offshoring. Across all project stages, researchers should not only concentrate on the client point of view but incorporate multiple points of view.

%X With increasing use of small portable computers, wireless networks and satellites, a trend to support "computing on the move" has emerged. This trend is known as mobile computing or "anytime" and "anywhere"  computing. Some people refer it as "Nomadic" computing. No matter which name is applied, all these terms really imply that a user may not maintain a fixed position in the network. The user is free to roam from one place to another. However the mobile user still expects uninterrupted network access and the ability to run some networked applications. To support such mobility, the user is typically provided a wireless interface to communicate with other fixed and mobile users.   The mobile computing environment can be described by the following attributes (a) mobile users, (b) mobile support stations or base stations serving an area, (c) wireless interface, (d) wireless medium with varying channel characteristics (due to fading, noise, interference, etc.) and (e) various applications requiring specific support. A mobile computing environment raises such issues as how to route packets as the mobile user (hosts) moves from one place to the other and how to overcome limitations including limited bandwidth and storage.    This tutorial presents an introduction to mobile computing, to the challenges introduced, and to emerging networking infrastructures for mobile computing.

%X The knowledge-based theory of the firm suggests that knowledge is the organizational asset that enables sustainable competitive advantage in hyper-competitive environments.  The emphasis on knowledge in today's organizations is based on the assumption that barriers to the transfer and replication of knowledge endow it with strategic importance. Many organizations are developing information systems designed specifically to facilitate the sharing and integration of knowledge.  Such systems are referred to as Knowledge Management System (KMS). Because KMS are just beginning to appear in organizations, little research and field data exists to guide the development and implementation of such systems or to guide expectations of the potential benefits of such systems.  This study provides an analysis of current practices and outcomes of KMS and the nature of KMS as they are evolving in fifty organizations. The findings suggest that interest in KMS across a variety of industries is very high, the technological foundations are varied, and the major concerns revolve around achieving the correct amount and type of accurate knowledge and garnering support for contributing to the KMS. Implications for practice and suggestions for future research are drawn from the study findings.

%X The personal computer industry is characterized by fierce competition for market share. The pace of technological change results in ever-shorter product lives and a continuous search for enhanced efficiency. To achieve these goals, firms must use information technology insightfully to redesign business processes, improve supply chain management and increase the value provided to the customer.             This competitive environment in the personal computer (PC) industry provides an exceptional laboratory for evaluating how companies use information technology to create business value. Compaq Computer Corporation is one of the most successful PC manufacturers. This case study, based on publicly available data, provides a comprehensive analysis of how strategic business use of information technology in concert with business process redesign improved the economic performance of this large-scale manufacturing company. Compaq has relied on strategic use of enterprise-wide IT to enhance its competitive position as the number one supplier of personal computers in the world.             This analysis begins with a review of the economics and competitiveness of the PC industry, and the role of information technology. To place Compaq's performance in perspective, we compare it to Dell Computer Company and Gateway Computer Company. We then profile the changes in Compaq's business strategy and its use of process reengineering and enterprise-wide information technology to implement strategic changes.             To understand Compaq's financial success better, we use the Balanced Scorecard to develop a causal model of firm performance that highlights the contribution of information technology to four different dimensions of that performance. We conclude that 1) information technology, along with 2) process reengineering, when properly aligned with 3) Compaq's business strategy contributed       substantially to Compaq's overall success and market leadership.

%X Enterprise Resource Planning systems are the new solution to business systems. These systems provide comprehensive business functionality in an integrated fashion using a state-of-the-art IT architecture. This trend towards enterprise systems in large and mid-sized organizations has a significant impact on IS careers paths. Enterprise systems essentially change fundamental business work processes thus implying that the system that supports these processes, and the design and development of these systems, also changed. Yet, most IS curricula do not provide significant coverage of ERP concepts, nor do they graduate students who are knowledgeable about these systems and the impact that these systems have on industry.  This paper identifies opportunities for incorporating the ERP body of knowledge into an IS program. The general spirit of the paper is that of experiential learning. That is, this paper focuses on curriculum that is enriched through the hands-on experience gained by students working on a real ERP system. The paper also discusses related topics such as costs and critical success factors.

%X This paper provides insight into identifying areas that help or hinder business-IT alignment. Alignment focuses on the activities that management performs to achieve cohesive goals across the organization. The aim of this paper is to determine the most important enablers and inhibitors to alignment.          The paper presents and analyzes the results of a multi-year study of strategic alignment.  Data were obtained from business and information technology executives of over 800 firms representing 15 industries who attended classes addressing alignment at IBM's Advanced Business Institute. The executives were asked to describe those activities that assist in achieving alignment and those which seem to hinder it.  These enablers and inhibitors to alignment were then analyzed with respect to industry, to time, and executive position.   The results indicate that certain activities can assist in the achievement of this state of alignment while others are clearly barriers.  Achieving alignment is evolutionary and dynamic.  It requires strong support from senior management, good working relationships, strong leadership, appropriate prioritization, trust, and effective communication, as well as a thorough understanding of the business environment.  Achieving alignment demands focusing on maximizing the enablers and minimizing the inhibitors.  The data show these factors to be constant over time and to be nearly identical for business executives and for IT executives. Furthermore, the data validate published anecdotal descriptions of enablers and inhibitors.

%X This tutorial compares Storage area Network (SAN) technology with previous storage management solutions with particular attention to promised benefits of scalability, interoperability, and high-speed LAN-free backups.  The paper provides an overview of what SANs are, why invest in them, and how SANs can be managed. The paper also discusses a primary management concern, the interoperability of vendor-specific SAN solutions. Bluefin, a storage management interface and interoperability solution is also explained. The paper concludes with discussion of SAN-related trends and implications for practice and research.

%X Champions are critical to the success of an information system implementation. Research shows that success in implementing a large information system may hinge on there being more than one type of champion. This study investigates the types of champions used in federated inter-organizational systems (FIOS) in a state telemedicine context. Case studies were conducted in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Wisconsin to identify the network of champions in state telemedicine systems. We found that FIOS that relied on a network of champions, including a sponsorship champion at the state level, as well as a technical champion and user champion at site locations, were more successful than those that lacked such a network. We suggest that our model of champions in FIOS applies not only to state telemedicine, but also to any large-scale system implementation spanning a federation of loosely coupled organizations.

%X This paper presents the design and three-year review of the MS program in Information Technology (MSIT) at Bentley College. The first class entered in 2001 and graduated in 2003.  Using the details of this program as a case study, the paper illustrates how the MSIS 2000 model for graduate curriculum in information systems was adapted to develop a program whose goal is to prepare systems integrators and whose courses have an architect focus. The three-year program review assessed the original design goals and whether the program implementation achieved those goals in terms of its orientation and positioning, its market, its architecture, the content of its courses, students learning and satisfaction, and faculty role in the delivery of the curriculum.  This case study can serve as a framework for self assessment. It should benefit faculty interested in building new programs or considering adjusting and tweaking their existing programs using the MSIS 2000 model curriculum as a frame of reference.

%X This paper develops and empirically tests a model to evaluate a manufacturer's strategy which provides customer relationship management (CRM) technology to its exclusive retailers. The impact of the strategy on manufacturer-retailer relationship quality is also examined. The research objectives are  (1) to identify and test factors that promote active implementation of CRM technology among small retail organizations; (2) to determine whether our expanded concept of CRM implementation that integrates customer information management activities and relationship marketing activities explains CRM performance better; and (3) to investigate whether a manufacturer's support contributes to manufacturer-retailer relationship quality.  Statistical analysis shows that the model provides an adequate fit to the data. The retailer's perception of the importance of customer information, manufacturer support, and trade area competitiveness significantly impacts the intensity of CRM implementation by small retailers. CRM implementation intensity positively influences the performance outcomes of CRM, which in turn greatly improves the quality of the manufacturer-retailer relationship. Different from our expectation, supporting retailers with CRM technology did not directly impact the manufacturer-retailer relationship quality. The ease of use of the CRM system also did not influence CRM implementation intensity significantly. The implications of these results and their importance for successful CRM implementation are discussed.

%X As information technology (IT) functions and their professionals become partners in managing the information resource of the organization, contributors to the strategic planning process and major players in the business, rather than appendages which can be outsourced, new skills and competencies are needed for IT personnel. In particular, the proposition that IT specialists will have to function more like change agents has been echoed by a number of writers. However, there has been no prior empirical research that explicitly measures the degree of knowledge that IT specialists possess about fundamental concepts in the management of change in organizations.  The present study offers to fill that gap. Data were collected using a survey instrument, the Managing Change Questionnaire, which was mailed to over 2,200 Canadian IT specialists. Of the sample, 18% returned completed questionnaires. ANOVA and t-test were used to identity differences among categories of respondents. Overall, IT practitioners' scores were acceptable but not particularly impressive. Results indicate that most IT specialists could pass the test regarding their knowledge of the concepts underlying organizational change management, and in the techniques needed to implement such a process, but they were not outstanding in that knowledge. Further, senior IT managers and systems/business analysts demonstrated a better grasp of many of the issues inherent in organizational change efforts than did technical personnel. Implications of these results for research as well as practice and educational programs in IT are discussed.

%X This exploratory study is an empirical test of a model of the activities involved in hacking attacks, and the conditions associated with the increase in these activities. In a methodological innovation, the variables in the model were measured using non-reactive, secondary data obtained from sixty months of official statistical data, from 1999 through 2003.  These variables were analyzed using stepwise regression. The results obtained support several of the model predictions.  1.	Increased Broadband access by home and small business users is associated with an increase in Reconnaissance activities by hackers looking for vulnerable systems.  2.	Increased Reconnaissance is associated with an increase in hacking attempts to obtain initial access through the use of Malicious Code.  3.	The increase in User Compromise is associated with the increase in Root Compromise, reflecting hackers' efforts towards escalation of privilege.  4.	The negative relationship between Root Compromise and Denial of Service supports the prediction that hacker frustration at failing to gain control of a resource may be one of the factors contributing to Denial of Service attacks.  5.	Environmental variables (Broadband and Number of Hosts) are positively related to one another.  These results suggest potentially significant implications for research and practice.

%X Document management plays an important role in R&D project management for government funding agencies, universities, and research institutions. The advent of Web services and XML presents new opportunities for e-document management. This paper describes a novel solution for processing large quantities of electronic documents in multiple formats within a short timeframe. The solution is based on Web services for integrating two-tiered distributed processing. It also involves a document extraction process for handling multiple document formats, with XML as the intermediate for information exchange. The application of the solution at the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) proved successful, and the general approach may be applied to a broad range of e-document management settings.

%X The Web is alive with news stories, pictures, music, and videos. How will organizations, managers, and other users find out what content is available, then locate it, analyze it, and make it meaningful? In this tutorial, we identify and classify eight types of information delivery systems (IDS) that we refer to as alpha, beta, gamma and delta and push technologies. For pull technologies we explain "surfing the Web", search engines, spiders and bots, personal agents, and finally evolutionary agents. For push technologies we explain Webcasting, channels and subscriptions, and data mining methods for determining preferences and filtering topics. We also examine the role of the evolutionary agents in push technologies. Throughout the paper, we provide examples of current pull and push technologies in each of the categories for pull and push. We include both personal and corporate applications. We then examine the managerial and social implications of higher-level IDS and suggest what is in store for users of information delivery systems in the future.

%X Healthcare information technology (HIT) is an exciting field to which information systems (IS) scholars have much to contribute. As the IS community continues to tackle enrollment and growth issues across the nation, HIT becomes an attractive topic for the IS educators to embrace. Careful consideration and domain understanding are needed to ensure a suitable depth and balance in curricula. The intent of this article is to provide guidance to the IS community to support and promote successful HIT educational courses and programs by investigating three important questions: (1) Does IS have a role in HIT? (2) Where does an IS educator look to begin with HIT education? (3) How do IS educators frame their vision for HIT curricula leveraging the discipline’s strengths? Our hope is that this article will illuminate HIT curriculum matters for the general IS faculty and generate purposeful debate regarding how best to position HIT education within the IS discipline if IS faculty want to join in the quest to successfully educate and place graduates in the growing health technology sector.

%X Even as information technology becomes globally ubiquitous, the pace of its dissemination varies across regions. For example, technology acceptance by ordinary workers in the Arabian region is generally slow, though its diffusion has recently exhibited substantial improvements. The research model proposed herein, based in the theory of planned behavior and the technology acceptance model, focuses on the effects of gender, because long-standing Saudi Arabian culture traditions and entrenched social norms define distinct gender roles. The test of the model and its associated hypotheses involves voluntary responses from 1,088 Arabian workers of fifty-six firms. The results show that the model can explain a significant portion of variance in workers’ intentions to use computer technology. Perceived usefulness seems to have the strongest impact on intention, followed by perceived behavioral control and subjective norms. In addition, gender moderates the effect of subjective norms on intentions and the influence of perceived usefulness on attitude, more prominently among male than among female workers. Overall, the findings imply relative differences in the explanatory power of prevalent theoretical models across different socio-cultural contexts and point to the important role of gender in technology acceptance. They also offer implications for research and practice.

%X Increasing uncertainty in the business world requires organizations to establish temporary, IT-enabled interorganizational information exchanges on short notice. Information sharing among disaster relief organizations represents an extreme case of these ad hoc interorganizational information exchanges, and therefore provides a good reference point for analyzing firms’ strategic competitive and cooperative considerations (co-opetition). While ad hoc IT-enabled interorganizational information sharing is particularly crucial in facilitating efficient disaster response, little research has outlined the main barriers and benefits of participation in these ad hoc information relationships, with the existing literature often overlooking the competitive aspects. We demonstrate that the ad hoc humanitarian context of natural disasters provides additional insights to existing understandings of information sharing costs and benefits under co-opetition. An elaborated game-theoretic model is developed that provides a theoretical foundation for empirical and modeling research on IT-enabled interorganizational information sharing, under co-opetition in disaster relief, as well as in other business contexts.

The panel addressed the controversial question—is there still a need for the ICIS Women’s Breakfast? Panelists were asked if the ICIS Women’s Breakfast could be seen as divisive, and if women’s issues are different from issues of diversity such as race or sexual orientation. They were also asked why they thought women were still underrepresented in our academic community, and if the lack of women at senior levels was a concern for the community. Finally, the panelists were asked what practices the community would need to adopt to combat what could be seen as structural discrimination in our community, which we believe reflects the wider world we live in. We frame the debate and the ensuing discussion in the literature about women in academia, and conclude with some practical and constructive recommendations for the community as a whole.

%X This article looks at the ways in which a number of charities are leading the United Kingdom’s ‘Third Sector’ in their use of ICT/IS capabilities to deliver innovations in a range of business critical activities. It shows that new ICT/IS capabilities afforded opportunities within different types of charities to deliver change. In the older charities established in the ‘pre-Internet’ era, these shifts tend to work with and reflect the existing ‘enterprise logic’ or established ‘ways of doing’. In the younger ‘Net generation’ organisations, the shifts tend to be more fluid in nature, enabling the delivery of new ways of doing and denoting the more flexible model of organisation upon which they were founded. Our research also shows that, in all of the charities, information and data capture and interrogation are intensifying.

To examine these issues, this study develops an instrument to measure attitudes toward MIS (Attitude toward success, usefulness, confidence in learning, and effectance motivation) and perceptions of both MIS and MIS professionals. Data from 1102 college students collected over a five-year period were then used to test gender differences within and across time periods. In spite of recent efforts, little progress has been made to improve attitudes and perceptions. However, in contrast to expectations, views appear not so different across gender.

%X The firms involved in analyzing the information technology industry (IT), such as Gartner, Forrester, and IDC, are reputed to have a major impact on both IT vendors and IT adopters through their influence over how IT actually is acquired and used. The purpose of this article is to take stock of the nascent stream of research on industry analysts that has developed in recent years in order to shed some light on the IT analysis industry―to analyze the IT industry analysts, if you will. Using an organizational field-level lens, we look at the business models of the firms that operate in this industry. We examine the main institutional work that the analysts in these firms perform as status arbiters, institutional carriers, network brokers, IT fashion setters, and knowledge entrepreneurs. We examine the competitive and institutional pressures faced by analysts in these firms. Finally, we propose two research agendas: (1) to study the impact that this industry has had, and could continue to have, on the IT industry as a whole, and (2) to study how the relationship between the academic information systems community and the IT analysis industry might co-evolve.

%X Budgets are shrinking in higher education, and greater financial accountability is simultaneously being demanded of universities. One of the consequences is that internal funding for research is more difficult to access than in years past. In such an environment, corporate sponsorship is an alternative that must be considered. In this article, we describe the forces compelling business schools to seek corporate sponsorship for research. Then, we discuss why some business faculty may perceive undesirable constraints in corporate-sponsored research. We also describe the challenges that researchers often need to address in order to secure corporate sponsorship and take full advantage of it. We conclude by describing some of the implications of this paradigm shift in research funding. When corporate funding is accessed and the relationship with the sponsoring organization is managed well, incentives are aligned among researchers, universities, and corporations. Benefits also include the development of new knowledge, solutions to real-world business problems, funding for researchers and universities, enhanced teaching, and a clear demonstration of the value of academic research.

%X This article proposes the development of an "interpretary," a compendium of interpretations of IS concepts and methods from different theoretical perspectives. Such an interpretary would recognize the importance of different theoretical perspectives while also moving toward an organized body of knowledge for the IS discipline. An idealized interpretary can be viewed as a two-dimensional concept interpretation matrix whose cells contain interpretations of specific concepts from specific theoretical perspectives. The first column is a list of important IS concepts. The other columns represent specific theoretical perspectives. Each cell contains an interpretation of a particular concept from a particular perspective Thus, the row for “user” would contain interpretations of that term from different perspectives. After explaining the idea of an interpretary, this article presents an illustrative example that compares interpretations of seventy-five selected IS concepts from two theoretical perspectives: (1) systems are technical artifacts that are used by users and (2) systems are IT-reliant work systems whose components include human participants. The first perspective is consistent with most systems analysis and design textbooks. The second is based on work system theory, the basis of the work system method. A more complete interpretary would include many other perspectives. The conclusion summarizes some of the challenges related to creating a more complete interpretary for the IS discipline.

First, to show that common conceptions and usages of the term ‘information’ are misleading; they lead to particular misunderstandings and misdirections, particularly amongst those disciplines and practices which locate information at their core. Second, to describe a conceptual framework which helps explain why information as conventionally conceived does not exist; instead in-formation is better considered an accomplishment with forma in pursuit of performa. Third, to demonstrate how such a conception of information leads to a re-conceptualization of both information systems and information technology and offers a more profound basis for developing trans-disciplinary understanding across the information disciplines. To help ground our discussion, we utilize a nonstandard case―that of human emotive facial expression. We show how an unpacking of this basic form of face-to-face communication supports our re-conceptualization of information.

%X In this research essay we contend that “emergence,” or the formation of complex wholes from parts, is a fundamental concept for comprehending the dynamic relationships between people, technology, and organizations during the ongoing cycles of design, appropriation, and use of information systems. Past research on emergent phenomena use the concept with varying degrees of attention to the structural and functional changes that have occurred to components in the emergent whole or to the implications of the processes by which emergence occurs. Refining our perspectives of emergence will guide researchers in clarifying how the socio-technical whole is greater than the constituent parts and how the whole comes into existence over time. In this article, we define three forms of emergence and provide both research exemplars and a framework for categorizing emergent phenomena to better articulate and refine how we understand emergent phenomena in Information Systems.

%X In this article we introduce policy informatics as an emerging research space. Policy informatics is the study of how information systems are leveraged toward solving complex public policy problems. When used to increase participation, leveraging information systems includes: (1) platforms for the public to participate and engage in policy processes and with public agencies; (2) public agencies to utilize technologies to take advantage of information reservoirs for evidence-driven policy design; and (3) public agencies to be more transparent, participatory, and collaborative. Presented in this article is one illustrative application of policy informatics—human-centered participatory platforms. When individuals and groups seek to collaborate to resolve policy issues, competing interests and adversarial positions on issues as well as an unawareness of the others’ perspectives often result in poor outcomes. Generating and disseminating feelings of empathy among members in these networks is crucial for mitigating conflicts. However, empathy generation and transfer is a complex challenge that requires systematic research within the design of participatory platforms. A thoughtful application of information systems (IS) can help bring diverse stakeholders together and promote cooperation by facilitating richer communication channels and timely feedback to generate a sense of shared community to pursue shared goals.

%X As incidents involving corporate social responsibility—or rather the lack thereof—hit headlines at regular intervals, stakeholders are becoming increasingly concerned about ethical issues, thus encouraging researchers to identify problematic business processes and pressing practitioners to start rectifying their questionable courses of action. In the meantime, information systems (IS) are becoming ever more pervasive and ubiquitous and are shaping and altering many of our everyday activities and behavior. We argue that when it comes to promoting ethical behaviors, IS can be used as powerful tools to empower stakeholders, and, thus, it is crucial to consider the role that IS can play in either advancing or deterring ethical—or conversely, unethical—behaviors. In this article, we present a research agenda for a new research program specifically concerned with the task of analyzing the social impact of existing IS and devising new ones that can be used to encourage ethical behavior. JustIS is the name of this program.

The article describes experiences of Fulbright Scholars, and argues for the need of more global education for IS academics. These views were presented during a panel session at the Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS) 2012. The panelists touched on logistical issues such as grant application, living conditions, working with a host institution’s faculty and students, and receiving support from their home university. Participants shared their experiences in India, Poland, Portugal, the Azores, Mongolia, and Nepal. The article concludes with lessons learned.

%X Electronic personal health records (PHRs) have significant promise in helping to empower patients and consumers in general to take more responsibility for managing their own health, with lower costs for the healthcare system. However, few empirical studies have been undertaken to understand patient perspectives on the benefits of PHRs.  This article describes an empirical study that proposes a theoretical model on PHR adoption and validates that model using the views of 389 Canadian patients. We found that perceived usefulness, security, privacy, and trust in PHRs, together with personal information technology innovativeness, are significant motivators of adoption, while computer anxiety may be an important deterrent. Overall, this study is a step toward understanding patient views that are key to the success of electronic PHRs. Growing adoption of this novel e-health approach is of importance as it may improve benefits for both patients and society.

%X This article describes the development of a multilevel theoretical model, which explains electronic symptom reporting (ESR) in the context of chronic disease management. ESR entails the use of patient-held technologies, such as electronic personal health records (ePHRs), for recording patient symptom data so that the information can be transmitted to a physician for interpretation. As patient recall of symptoms is critical to treatment effectiveness, ESR offers several advantages over traditional symptom reporting methods. The patient has the ability to conveniently collect symptom data, which can subsequently be viewed by the physician in an interpretable and relevant manner. This article proposes a theoretical model, which integrates the perspectives of both patient and physician, in order to inform theory development in this area.

%X Although information technology (IT) is often argued to have the potential to enable greater patient participation in healthcare delivery, how IT empowers patients to take charge of their own health is a less explored area. This study explores how IT-enabled communication plays a significant role in shaping the patients’ psychological empowerment for managing a chronic disease—diabetes. Psychological empowerment reflects a patient’s cognitive response and motivation to manage the disease. Two dimensions of psychological empowerment relevant in the context of chronic disease management (e.g., meaning as manifested through perceived education benefits and self-awareness to enable self-efficacy for effective management) are suggested to have positive effects on life changing interventions and patient satisfaction. We argue that the medium of communication between the patients and providers influences the psychological empowerment. Media reinforcement is, thus, hypothesized to impact the relationship between self-awareness and life changing interventions. The conceptual model is tested using archival data collected from a survey of seventy-eight patients that were involved in diabetes management education programs. The results indicate that rich media enabled by IT can play a significant role in patient empowerment, and influence the outcome of chronic disease management.

%X This article reports on the formative evaluation of WebPEP (“Web-Based Patient Education Program”), an interactive video education project at ErasmusMC–Sophia Children’s Hospital (SCH) in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Through monthly live webcasts, doctors, nurses, psychologists, and other healthcare professionals affiliated to SCH’s Cystic Fibrosis Team gave presentations on medical and psychosocial aspects related to cystic fibrosis (CF). These webcasts were first intended to educate and be educational to children between the ages of twelve and eighteen, but during the first year of the project they failed to attract this specific group. Instead, they generated unexpected enthusiasm among parents of young patients. The central question in this article is: How were patients “integrated” in the development of the WebPEP application? We show how the project’s initiator reacted to the lacking participation by prospective users: informed by the evaluation, he gradually shifted his attention from live interaction to the expansion of the video library, where the webcasts were stored for on demand viewing. Based on interviews and participant observations, we describe how the initiator reconfigured the WebPEP application and its users, and therewith reframed the CF Centre’s online patient education strategy. We discuss the importance of investigating the prospective and actual use of patient-centered e-health (PCEH) applications, and argue that a single technological artefact can be involved in different, coexisting practices of patient-centeredness. We conclude with a reflection on how formative research methods can contribute to the development of PCEH.

%X E-health systems are often designed without considering user-centered design principles. Past research on the topic of patient-centered e-health (PCEH) has lacked focus on the design and development of a PCEH artifact and the process for its development. In this study, information systems design theory (ISDT) is applied to design, develop, and evaluate an e-health system based on PCEH principles. The goal of the artifact in this study is to improve patient understanding of diagnoses, procedures, medications, and post-discharge instructions and empower patients with the information needed pre- and post-discharge to make informed healthcare decisions. The artifact justification, meta-requirements, meta-design, development, and evaluation are presented in multiple iterations—beginning with a simple picture book, and ending with a Web-based, mobile, multimedia system. Findings indicate that a PCEH approach can be useful for achieving multiple design goals. The artifact illustrates achievement of an important organizational quality improvement goal for the case study organization involved, a key physician goal to improve patient-physician engagement, and an important patient goal—to improve understanding about patient-specific diagnoses and health conditions prior to discharge from a hospital visit and initiation of home health care.

%X Although the Internet is in its second decade of wide-spread adoption, many patient-centered health websites are still in a phase of early adoption, scrambling to define and defend market segments in a shifting healthcare information landscape. Consequently, healthcare and health information providers are jockeying for position in a dynamic industry trying to serve different patients’ needs. To understand the situation, this article takes the approach of Patient-centered e-Health (PCEH) and makes three contributions. One, we empirically test the PCEH framework on patient-focused websites. Two, given the PCEH framework, we identify five categories of websites that serve different segments of the patient-centered health information market. Three, we analyze the five categories in terms of different features and derive a classification model. This article helps us better understand PCEH websites and guide the future development of online healthcare and health information services.

%X Seniors’ social activities are critical in assuring their quality of life, and seniors’ quality of life (QoL) declines with the deterioration of their social activity. Social support from online social relationships has been considered to be important determinants of QoL, and is an important goal of the design of online health communities to support patient-centered e-health initiatives. In this study, we find that, rather than attempting to improve seniors’ quality of life through interventions and online community platforms that are designed directly to increase social interactions and focus on social relationship formation, it is more effective for such online health communities to be designed to facilitate information sharing. Information sharing may be an easy way for seniors to become familiar with the online environment and pave the way for subsequent online social relationships. This study investigated seniors’ online information sharing behaviors and the impacts on their quality of life. Survey data from 130 seniors was used to test our research model. Seniors’ online information seeking and provision indirectly affect their quality of life, and the relative importance of information seeking and information provision varies depending on the seniors’ perceived subjective age, i.e., cognitive age.

%X Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is an enabling technology that can provide organizations with unprecedented improved visibility and traceability of items throughout their journey in the value chain. This paper explores how RFID can impact traditional business models or create new ones. In particular, we propose an RFID business model framework and use it to show how value can be created for organizations, suppliers, customers, and business partners. We also identify the major dynamic phases of RFID and their corresponding impact on RFID business models. A taxonomy of 12 specific RFID business models is also presented, reflecting the wide spectrum of potential directions and applications of the technology. Finally, we present a case study to test the practical and theoretical relevance of our conceptual models. The paper outlines the need for technology managers to take a holistic approach to RFID business model innovation, taking into account the interrelated technical, strategic, organizational, and external environmental factors.

%X Management of the enterprise architecture has become increasingly recognized as a crucial part of both business and IT management. Still, a common understanding and methodological consistency seems far from being developed. Acknowledging the significant role of research in moving the development process along, this article employs different bibliometric methods, complemented by an extensive qualitative interpretation of the research field, to provide a unique overview of the enterprise architecture literature. After answering our research questions about the collaboration via co-authorships, the intellectual structure of the research field and its most influential works, and the principal themes of research, we propose an agenda for future research based on the findings from the above analyses and their comparison to empirical insights from the literature. In particular, our study finds a considerable degree of co-authorship clustering and a positive impact of the extent of co-authorship on the diffusion of works on enterprise architecture. In addition, this article identifies three major research streams and shows that research to date has revolved around specific themes, while some of high practical relevance receive minor attention. Hence, the contribution of our study is manifold and offers support for researchers and practitioners alike.

%X Information systems faculty strive to educate students and provide them with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed as IS professionals. Given the dynamic nature of the IS discipline and workplace, what to teach our undergraduates, especially regarding the issue of balancing technical and “soft-skills,” presents an ongoing challenge. While the ACM/AIS IS 2010 Curriculum offers faculty a place to start, we suggest an approach to enhancing traditional IS curriculum guidelines through active engagement with an industry Advisory Board. During the course of a fall and a spring meeting, we posed two questions to our MIS Advisory Board members: “If I only knew _____ [during college, first job, etc.]” and “How do we share and impart your wisdom with our students?” This article illustrates the method (modified Nominal Group Technique) we used to collect our Board’s wisdom and advice, refine it, and deliver it to our undergraduate students. We also share several ways that our MIS faculty integrate professional development into our undergraduate MIS program.

%X Existing literature lacks a common taxonomy and systematic integration necessary for building cumulative knowledge on the nature of trust in an information systems context. Hence, this article explores online trust’s multidimensional nature within the context of online stores. This article develops a framework for classifying trust dimensions and to investigate their influences on behaviors in new and familiar business-to-consumer (B-to-C) e-commerce environments. Specifically, we classify trust dimensions into two levels: general trust (beliefs toward the general e-commerce environment and infrastructure) and specific trust (beliefs regarding a specific e-commerce shopping experience). Specific trust is further delineated into trust in the merchant and trust in the technology artifact, i.e., the website. The integrative framework was tested in two separate empirical studies using e-commerce stores that were either new or familiar to the subjects. The results show that general trust mechanisms are important to consumers in a new e-commerce environment. In contrast, when shopping in a familiar e-commerce store, consumers pay more attention to the current Web experience, diminishing the salience of general trust. This article contributes to the literature by developing an integrative framework of trust and by providing insights into the influences of trust dimensions on purchase decisions in new and familiar e-commerce environments.

%X The percentage of obese individuals in the population has increased exponentially over the last decade, making obesity a phenomenon of significant global concern. Individual behaviors, preferences and lifestyle choices are subject to social and environmental influences and social networks have been identified as a key contributor to the global obesity epidemic.  Numerous empirical studies have found a relationship between dimensions of social capital, well-being and population health. It is the thesis of this article that social capital in online social networks might be similarly associated. Addressing previously identified gaps in the literature, our conceptual model enables the analysis of the relationships between the structure and content of an individual’s online social network, the resulting opportunities and limitations to accessing resources and his or her health-related behaviors and body weight is introduced. Moreover, the model incorporates potential social capital as a special type of social capital in online social networks and uses network-based measures instead of self-reported data. Additionally, literature-based hypotheses discussing the relationships between the constructs of the model are presented. Establishing profound theoretical groundwork, this article encourages future research crossing the boundaries between information systems, health informatics and sociology. This study concludes by proposing a new Facebook e-health application to collect longitudinal data using the aforementioned conceptual model in order to explore the presented ideas further.

In particular, they have debated whether the IT artifact is unwisely taken for granted and whether or not it lies at the field’s core. Here, applying Brian Arthur’s general theory of technology, I suggest that one may theorize IS itself as an evolving family of technologies. From this perspective, one may open new avenues for IS research—for, in particular, historical and other related studies where the unit of analysis is the technology itself and the focus is its evolution.

%X Social networking websites have not only become the most prevalent communication tools in today’s digital age but also one of the top big data sources. Big data advocates promote the promising benefits of big data applications to both users and practitioners. However, public polls show evidence of heightened privacy concerns among Internet and social media users. We review the privacy literature based on protection motivation theory and the theory of planned behavior to develop an APCO model that incorporates novel factors that reflect users’ familiarity with big data. Our results, which we obtained from using a cross-sectional survey design and structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques, support most of our proposed hypotheses. Specifically, we found that that awareness of big data had a negative impact on and awareness of big data implications had a positive impact on privacy concerns. In turn, privacy concerns impacted self-disclosure concerns positively and self-disclosure accuracy negatively. We also considered other antecedents of privacy concerns and tested other alternative models to examine the mediating role of privacy concerns, to control for demographic variables, and to investigate different roles of the trust construct. Finally, we discuss the results of our findings and the theoretical and practical implications.

%X Enterprise architecture (EA) frameworks offer principles, models, and guidance to help one develop an EA program. Due to EA’s flexible and abstract nature, there is a proliferation of EA frameworks in practice. Yet, comparison studies to make sense of them are far from satisfactory in that they lack a theoretical foundation for comparison criteria and do not meaningfully interpret the differences. In this paper, I propose a comparison approach using EA essential elements—the underlying key features of EA programs—to distinguish EA frameworks. Based on the extant literature, I identify eight elements, each with its own theoretical justification and empirical evidence. I illustrate how to use these elements to evaluate eight popular EA frameworks. The results show three ideal types of EA frameworks: technical, operational, and strategic EA. Each type has a different focus, set of assumptions, and historical context. The essential elements offer a more systematic way to evaluate EA frameworks. In addition, they shift attention from the maturity models often used in EA development to focus on particular EA elements being implemented by organizations.

%X The paper examines the issue of the information systems (IS) discipline’s influence as represented by its key journals. We examine the well-studied topics of cumulative tradition and reference disciplines from two unique perspectives: cohesion and stability. We demarcate journals into “IS journals” and “non-IS journals that are receptive to IS work” and examine the sphere of influence of these journals based on citations over time. Specifically, we compute a log-multiplicative model to identify subareas in the IS discipline and assess journal influence using the index of structural influence based on citations from a basket of 42 IS and IS-related journals over four periods: 1999-2000, 2004-2005, 2009-2010, and 2013-2014. Results indicate that the IS discipline has established a stable and cohesive knowledge underpinning, which converges with emerging (newer) journals and diverges with non-IS journals during the late period. These results suggest that the discipline has developed boundary conditions and a strong cumulative tradition. Furthermore, based on our analysis, pure IS journals gradually gained dominance in their own network and even started to exert influence in the broader network of journals. These findings provide a unique complement to other recent studies that signify the IS discipline’s influence.

Among the management-centered journals, the researchers ranked Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association and Journal of Medical Internet Research as A+ journals; among the clinical-focused journals, they ranked BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making and IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics as A+ journals. We found that journal longevity (years in print) had an effect on ranking scores such that longer standing journals had an advantage over their more recent counterparts, but this effect was only moderately significant and did not guarantee a favorable ranking position. Various stakeholders may use this list to advance the state of the e-health discipline. There are both similarities and differences between the present ranking and the one developed earlier in 2010.

%X Software as a service (SaaS) offers an innovative way to deliver software over the Internet to distributed organizations. While more and more SaaS providers are joining the market and competition among providers becomes more intense, we need to understand the considerations of potential clients. Built on transaction cost theory and social exchange theory, this study empirically investigates, with a national survey of IT/IS executives, the role of economic factors and the impact of social relationships on the economic factors in firms’ deciding to adopt SaaS. We found that cost savings are a critical consideration in SaaS and that social relationships exert a strong, positive direct impact on cost savings and positively moderate the impact of cost savings on SaaS. This paper expands our theoretical understanding of the SaaS phenomenon and provides some managerial insights.

%X The teaching case describes India’s telecommunications market as it went through a major transformation due to its adopting mobile telephony. The country’s huge market size and low teledensity have provided an attractive opportunity for foreign multinationals. Telenor entered the Indian market through a joint venture with Unitech Wireless under the brand name of Uninor and targeted the value-conscious segment of mobile customers with its attractive pricing schemes. After a few years of rapid growth, Uninor faced a huge business risk when the Supreme Court of India ruled that its purchased spectrum was illegal. The case describes the aftermath of the 2G spectrum scam and how it adversely affected Uninor’s future. At this critical juncture, Telenor faced a strategic decision dilemma. Should it continue its operations in the ever-growing Indian mobile market or should it cut its losses and exit before receiving further damage to its global brand? This teaching case imparts important lessons about doing telecommunications-related business in an emerging economy with high returns and immense business risks.

%X Controlling organizational insiders’ security behaviors is an important management concern. Research presents fear appeals as a viable security control to promote protective security behaviors. To date, research has proven security-related fear appeals have to effectively control insiders’ security behaviors. However, from critically examining fear appeals, we find a different story. Specifically, we critically analyze security-related fear appeal research from two ontological positions: critical realism and critical constructivism. The critical realist analysis identifies several issues with existing fear appeal research, which particular research traditions may cause. We explicate these traditions and issues in the paper. The critical constructivist analysis draws on critical management studies of control and Foucault’s work to identify the identities, beliefs, and values that fear appeals promote and the ways in which fear appeals create discursive closures that limit the consideration and discussion of other positions. Based on the two analyses, we provide important directions for future fear appeal research.

Extending recent work in the IS literature, this tutorial discusses the risks and rewards of using data gathered on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. We examine the characteristics of MTurk workers and the resulting method biases that may be exacerbated in MTurk data. Based on this analysis, we present a 2x2 matrix to illustrate the categories of IS research questions that are and are not amenable to MTurk data. We suggest that MTurk data is more appropriate for generalizing studies that examine diverse cognition than for contextualizing studies or those involving shared cognition. Finally, we offer a set of practical recommendations for researchers who wish to collect data on MTurk.

%X Researchers have emphasized theory’s pivotal importance in the information systems (IS) discipline since its inception. As in many science disciplines, IS scholars’ ability to understand and contribute to theory is an important qualification in research practice. As a discipline, we require solid foundations for why we engage with theory, what theory is for us, and how we work with theory. We synthesize and reflect on the debates on theories and theorizing in the IS discipline. In doing so, we inform (particularly new) authors about the current state of the IS discipline’s debate on theory and theorizing and help them identify opportunities in theorizing to put theory to work. We do not intend to advocate or cement that status quo we portray but rather, through informing the community about it, to support early efforts to further develop and move beyond the current state of the debate on theory and theorizing in IS research.

%X Crisis response is the most critical stage in crisis management during which actors make important decisions on mitigating a crisis. However, the decision making in such situations is a complex sociotechnical phenomenon. The literature specifies crisis response to include four steps (i.e., observation, interpretation, choice, and dissemination) and suggests a sociotechnical approach for analyzing them. However, we still lack theoretical guidelines for conducting sociotechnical analyses of the complexity involved in the crisis response activities. To help fill this knowledge gap, we present an interpretive case study on Kathmandu Living Labs’ (KLL) role in the response to the Nepal earthquake in 2015. We analyze the case using actor-network theory (ANT) and explore how a social entrepreneur from KLL enrolled different technical and human actors and mobilized them in the crisis response. We use ANT to explore the temporal and interdependent role of digital volunteers, local communities, and technologies in responding to the crisisWe demonstrate the usefulness of ANT’s translation process in understanding the complex sociotechnical process of crisis response in disaster events.

%X One of the four values listed in the Agile Manifesto emphasizes customer collaboration over contract negotiation, yet the literature has not explained what constitutes customer collaboration and how to assess it. Little research has examined the nature and dimensions of collaboration in the context of agile software development. Based on a grounded theory methodology and using interview data collected from five software development outsourcing vendors in China, we explore the nature and key underlying dimensions of collaboration in agile software development. Five major dimensions of collaboration emerged from our analysis: mutual benefits, engagement, coordination, communication, and knowledge sharing. In turn, each dimension comprises key subdimensions that provide a comprehensive view of collaboration. By revealing the underlying nature and key dimensions, we provide a conceptual basis for operationalizing collaboration that one can employ in future quantitative studies on agility and other project outcomes. Our study results suggest that collaboration in agile software development is multifaceted and mutually occurring in both directions between the customer and the vendor rather than single dimensional as the term “customer collaboration” in the Agile Manifesto indicates.

%X In this guide, we introduce researchers in the behavioral sciences in general and MIS in particular to text analysis as done with latent semantic analysis (LSA). The guide contains hands-on annotated code samples in R that walk the reader through a typical process of acquiring relevant texts, creating a semantic space out of them, and then projecting words, phrase, or documents onto that semantic space to calculate their lexical similarities. R is an open source, popular programming language with extensive statistical libraries. We introduce LSA as a concept, discuss the process of preparing the data, and note its potential and limitations. We demonstrate this process through a sequence of annotated code examples: we start with a study of online reviews that extracts lexical insight about trust. That R code applies singular value decomposition (SVD). The guide next demonstrates a realistically large data analysis of Stack Exchange, a popular Q&A site for programmers. That R code applies an alternative sparse SVD method. All the code and data are available on github.com.

%X The growing adoption of platforms such as Uber and Airbnb has contributed to the emergence of an access economy, which has disrupted a number of incumbent industries in the process. In this study, we examine goCatch, one of Australia’s largest e-hailing and ride-sharing multi-sided platforms. From our investigations, we find that the technology affordances of multi-sided digital platforms can help to deliver new commercial services and offerings to consumers of the platform, which enables new forms of consumption and, subsequently, disrupts the incumbent industry. Our findings provide the empirical premise for a model that illustrates the role of technology in enabling consumer recognition, consumer engagement, and consumer transposition in the e-hailing context. For theory, we build on extant literature to identify the forms of motivational affordances leveraged in disruptive platforms and technologies. For practice, we conceptualize the function of technology-enabled gamification as an emergent strategy that one can use to induce consumers to change their behaviors, develop their technical skills and drive innovation that plays a central role in enabling digital disruption. This study also clarifies the relationship between technology affordances and value creation against the backdrop of the emergent access economy.

%X Practitioners and academics alike have highlighted that information systems (IS) research may currently have limited use and value to practitioners. Further, research provides examples of positive links between management practices prevalent in the media and their influence on societal views. We focus on increasing relevance of future academic research to practitioners by identifying sources of misalignment between practitioner and academic literatures on the topic of information technology service management (ITSM) and by developing a possible research agenda to address these misalignments.  We employ an entity annotator and keyword analysis to compare the main topics evident in academic and practitioner literatures on ITSM and focus on those salient in practitioner literature. Our results suggest that the topics of framework co-implementation, regulations, ITSM tools, gamification, and cloud computing all present fertile grounds for relevant research in ITSM and IS more broadly. Thus, our paper offers a unique way for academics to understand how they can best assist practitioners while increasing the relevance of academic research.

%X Researchers, governments, and funding agencies are calling on research disciplines to embrace open data—data that anyone can access and use. They have done so based on the premise that research efforts can draw and generate several benefits from open data because it might provide further insight and enable individuals to replicate and extend current knowledge in different contexts. These potential benefits, coupled with a global push towards open data policies, bring open data into the agenda of research disciplines, which includes information systems (IS). In this paper, we respond to these developments as follows. We outline themes in the ongoing discussion around open data in the IS discipline. The themes fall into two clusters: 1) the motivation for open data includes themes of mandated sharing, benefits to the research process, extending the life of research data, and career impact; and 2) the implementation of open data includes themes of governance, socio-technical system, standards, data quality, and ethical considerations. In this paper, we outline the findings from a pre-ICIS 2016 workshop on the topic of open data. The workshop discussion confirmed themes and identified issues that require attention in terms of the approaches that IS researchers currently use. The IS discipline offers a unique knowledge base, tools, and methods that can advance open data across disciplines. Based on our findings, we provide suggestions on how IS researchers can drive the open data conversation. Further, we provide advice for adopting and establishing procedures and guidelines for archiving, evaluating, and using open data.

%X Despite its criticality to the success of information system (IS) projects, knowledge sharing among IS projects is generally ineffective compared to knowledge sharing in IS projects. Although several mechanisms for knowledge sharing exist in the literature, it is difficult to determine which mechanism one should use in a specific context. We lack work that concisely and comprehensively classifies these mechanisms. Based on a literature review, we extracted information from 33 studies and identified twelve mechanisms for sharing knowledge among IS projects. Then, we derived a taxonomy for these mechanisms, which extends previous research by both adapting existing mechanisms and complementing the set of dimensions used for their classification. The results help to systematically structure the fields of knowledge management and IS projects. Both research and practice can use this taxonomy to better understand knowledge in this domain and effectively adopt mechanisms for a particular application.

%X With the growth of information technology (IT), there is a growing global concern about the environmental impact of such technologies. As such, academics in several research disciplines consider research on green IT a vibrant theme. While the disparate knowledge in each discipline is gaining substantial momentum, we need a consolidated multi-disciplinary view of the salient findings of each research discipline for green IT research to reach its full potential. We reviewed 390 papers published on green IT from 2007 to 2015 in three disciplines: computer science, information systems and management. The prevailing literature demonstrates the value of this consolidated approach for advancing our understanding on this complex global issue of environmental sustainability. We provide an overarching theoretical perspective to consolidate multi-disciplinary findings and to encourage information systems researchers to develop an effective cumulative tradition of research.

We conducted these interventions as projects in an introductory undergraduate IS class in a public university in the western US. Sadly, none were effective in encouraging more female students to consider majoring in IS.

%X A variety of organizations around the world use complex information systems (e.g., enterprise resource planning and supply chain management systems). However, poor usability caused by system complexity continues to frustrate users and damage the reputation of these systems. In this study, we address usability issues with complex information systems from the human-computer collaboration perspective by modeling user-system interaction as a joint activity between the system and its users. We propose a conceptual model for user-system collaboration, elaborate on the components in the model and the relationships between the components, derive the required capabilities for collaborative information systems, and establish conceptual relationships between system collaborative behaviors and usability. We use empirical evidence gathered from a qualitative field study on ERP systems to illustrate the model and the possible impact of system collaborativeness (i.e., the presence or absence of collaborative capabilities) on usability. We do so to provide a strong conceptual foundation for modeling user-system collaboration and to encourage designers to employ the collaboration metaphor during system design and, thus, help them develop future complex information systems with better usability.

%X Despite extensive research over the past several decades, assessing information system (IS) project success is still a challenging endeavor. While the traditional approach takes process performance (time and budget) and product performance (functional and non-functional requirements) into account, the contemporary perspective acknowledges the more comprehensive character of project success and emphasizes the criticality of stakeholder satisfaction. Continuing previous research, we propose and test a model with customer satisfaction as the uppermost criterion of IS project success and process performance and product performance as its determinants. Following recent calls for researchers to investigate the explicit linkage between success factors and success criteria, we also analyze the influence of process transparency on process and product performance. We conducted a survey via a questionnaire with IS experts in Germany. We contribute to a deeper understanding of IS project success by indicating that customer satisfaction is less a matter of time and budget and that a stronger emphasis should be placed on product performance. Moreover, our results illuminate the role of process transparency in IS projects showing that it contributes to both process and product performance.

Recognizing the potential of “big data” to offer new insights for decision making and innovation, panelists at the two events discussed how organizations can use and manage big data for competitive advantage. In addition, expert panelists helped to identify research gaps. While emerging research in the academic community identifies some of the issues in acquiring, analyzing, and using big data, many of the new developments are occurring in the practitioner community. We bridge the gap between academic and practitioner research by presenting a big data analytics framework that depicts a process view of the components needed for big data analytics in organizations. Using practitioner interviews and literature from both academia and practice, we identify the current state of big data research guided by the framework and propose potential areas for future research to increase the relevance of academic research to practice.

%X Analyzing conceptual models such as process models, data models, or organizational charts is useful for several purposes in information systems engineering (e.g., for business process improvement, compliance management, model driven software development, and software alignment). To analyze conceptual models structurally and semantically, so-called model query languages have been put forth. Model query languages take a model pattern and conceptual models as input and return all subsections of the models that match this pattern. Existing model query languages typically focus on a single modeling language and/or application area (such as analysis of execution semantics of process models), are restricted in their expressive power of representing model structures, and/or abstain from graphical pattern specification. Because these restrictions may hamper query languages from propagating into practice, we close this gap by proposing a modeling language-spanning structural model query language based on flexible graph search that, hence, provides high structural expressive power. To address ease-of-use, it allows one to specify model queries using a diagram. In this paper, we present the syntax and the semantics of the diagramed model query language (DMQL), a corresponding search algorithm, an implementation as a modeling tool prototype, and a performance evaluation.

%X Different from classification and taxonomy, typology meets the criteria of a theory and is a unique form of theory building. Typology is a good first step in exploring a research topic, and, therefore, we are concerned with building typological theories for underdeveloped topics with limited studies. We propose a four-step approach involving content analysis, multidimensional scaling, judgmental analysis, and empirical testing to guide researchers in developing typological theories in their domains of interest using a quantitative approach that rides on empirical methods and industry wisdom. Previous research in information security has paid little attention to employees’ deviant behavior in the workplace. We, therefore, built a typology of information security deviant behavior as an example to illustrate the theory development process. We discuss the theoretical, methodological, and practical implications of this study.

%X Analytics has become a key element of the business decision process over the last decade. In today’s competitive business world, organizations have found out that their data and how they use it can make them much more competitive. According to many research institutions (e.g., Gartner and McKinsey), the worldwide market for business analytics solutions in practice, research, and education is growing exponentially. As the use of analytics become widespread, business school graduates need to gain the necessary knowledge and skill sets to use these assets effectively. In the spirit of analytical thinking, we developed a practice-oriented business case that uses a sample scenario, managerial dashboards, betting templates, model repository and model performance management metrics that teaches predictive analytics concepts and decision making with incomplete information intended for MIS courses. Through exercises and interactions, students gain the skills, knowledge and experience necessary to be become effective decision makers through applying analytical thinking. Digital copies of workshop lesson plans with dashboard and data entry templates can be downloaded free of charge from the Teradata University Network.

We reviewed all papers from seven major IS journals and coded them based on topics studied, methodologies used, models rendered, and paradigmatic approaches taken. We captured trends in IS research and compared them to previous trends that extend across many periods from past studies. We present major shifts and trends in IS research and discuss voids in the literature. Results reveal that electronic commerce was the most studied topic and that the survey method maintained its dominance in conducting research. Also, the majority of IS researchers used the multi-tier influence diagrams to portray their research models, and the positivist approach was still the most used research approach.

%X Business intelligence (BI) combined with business analytics (BA) is an increasingly prominent strategic objective for many organizations. As a pedagogical subject, BI/BA is still in its infancy, and, in order for this to mature, we need to develop an undergraduate model BI/BA curriculum. BI/BA as an academic domain is emerging as a hybrid of disciplines, including information systems, statistics, management science, artificial intelligence, computer science, and business practice/theory. Based on IS 2010’s model curriculum constructs (Topi et al., 2010), we explore two curricular options: a BI/BA concentration in a typical IS major and a comprehensive, integrated BI/BA undergraduate major. In support, we present evidence of industry need for BI/BA, review the current state of BI/BA education, and compare anticipated requirements for BI/BA curricula with the IS 2010 model curriculum. For this initial phase of curricular design, we postulate a preliminary set of knowledge areas relevant for BI/BA pedagogy in a multi-disciplinary framework. Then we discuss avenues for integrating these knowledge areas to develop professionally prepared BI/BA specializations at the undergraduate level. We also examine implications for both AACSB and ABET accreditation and describe the next phase of applying the IS 2010 concept structure to BI/BA curriculum development.

%X Better managing diabetes has become a global priority, especially given the exponential increase in the number of diabetes patients and the financial implications of treating this silent epidemic. In this paper, we focus on how it might be possible to use a mobile technology solution to support and enable superior diabetes monitoring and management. To test this solution, we examined the context of gestational diabetes and adopted a non-blinded randomized control trial with two-arm cross over applied to a private hospital in Victoria, Australia. Further, we use an accountable care system as the theoretical lens and, from this, develop a conceptual framework to bridge evidence-based management with technologies. Theoretically, we unpack McCleallan, McKethan, Lewis, Roski, and Fisher’s (2010) study with our conceptual framework that comprises providers for information (evidence-based management) and technology (smartphone). We enhance Muhlestein, Croshaw, Merrill, Pena, and James’ (2013) accountable care paradigm with three concepts: 1) quality of life, 2) evidence-based management, and 3) affordable care. From the perspective of practice, far-reaching implications have arisen particularly for hospital management pertaining to the cost and quality of care issues. In particular, it appears that adapting mobile technology solutions such as smartphones to support various aspects of care and patient-clinician interactions is a prudent choice to minimize costs and yet provide high-quality care.

Despite its small size and a last-mover disadvantage, since its founding in 1994, Cybage had enjoyed growth rates higher than rest of the industry. Had Cybage developed a set of capabilities that differentiated the company from its peers and enabled it to expand from a handful of IT practitioners to a company with nearly 4,000 professionals and a global footprint? Or did Cybage’s growth merely reflect the general expansion of India’s knowledge economy? In this case , we overview the Indian IT industry’s evolution and highlight the concepts of entry timing, IT capabilities, service-dominant logic, and value co-creation by considering questions regarding Cybage’s key differentiators and capabilities, avenues of future growth, and the applicability of Cybage’s current capabilities to other domains of IT service provisioning.

%X After decades of research and ambitious political programs, we still observe imbalances in the treatment of people on the basis of gender, age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, disability, and social background. Such an issue raises questions about the degree to which information systems can help to overcome such imbalance; for instance, if design principles can be formalized to reshape information systems’ design into a different, more-inclusive direction. We contend that IS falls short in tackling this issue. We took the theme of ICIS 2013 (“reshaping society through information systems”) as an opportunity to reflect on the multiple aspects of social inclusion in the design and the resulting shape of information systems via a panel discussion. The fruitful discussion during the panel delivered more in-depth results than merely advocating a stance for more diversity in the IS workforce. Building on the principles of design science, we believe that our field can help reshape the digital economy. As a key takeaway, the panel and additional points added in this paper in the light of discussion at ICIS 2013 provide guidance on the impact of gender in IS theorizing as a demonstration example and reflect on the trend towards social design in the IS research community.

This panel, delivered at AMCIS in Auckland on 8 December 2014, resulted in thought-provoking dialog that generated critical reflection on several themes linking technology and practical wisdom that aligned with the conference theme “Integral IS: The Embedding of Information Systems in Business, Government and Society”. The panel found common ground, although each author began from a different starting position. The common ground was that neither utopian nor dystopian stances on the value of technology achieve much practical value. Instead, perennial universal insights of wisdom viewed in a contemporary, practical, and scientific context may provide a path in technology research, design, management, and use. We believe the topics addressed during the panel session, which we summarize in this paper, are vital and relevant to the information systems field as a whole. The panel’s deliberations hold importance for academics and practitioners alike and have implications that extend to individuals, organizations, and society at large.

%X Recently, the topic of big data and analytics has received renewed attention from academia and practitioners. There has been an increase in demand for skills in big data and analytics due to the increasing speed, variety, and volume of information. Several research reports have shown that big data and analytics remain top priority for CIOs. A recent study shows how a company accurately predicted a teen girl’s pregnancy via the company’s big data algorithm. However, there are dark sides to big data and analytics. A panel discussion addressed topics concerning how companies ensure that big data projects clearly define measurable goals up front, methods that companies use to ensure maximum return and most effectively, and ways that companies evolve culture, processes, and technology to simultaneously maximize return. Most companies are looking at how they can effectively manage their business more through using their data assets. Companies today target an average return of $3.50 dollars for every dollar spent on big data projects. However, most are only returning a fraction of that today, which leaves room for improvement and the possibility that organizations will push back against new analytic technologies. In this paper, we cover these topics that a panel of researchers at AMCIS 2014 in Savannah, GA, discussed.

%X Cloud computing is drawing attention from both practitioners and researchers, and its adoption among organizations is on the rise. The focus has mainly been on minimizing fixed IT costs and using the IT resource flexibility offered by the cloud. However, the promise of cloud computing is much greater. As a disruptive technology, it enables innovative new services and business models that decrease time to market, create operational efficiencies and engage customers and citizens in new ways. However, we are still in the early days of cloud computing, and, for organizations to exploit the full potential, we need knowledge of the potential applications and pitfalls of cloud computing. Maturity models provide effective methods for organizations to assess, evaluate, and benchmark their capabilities as bases for developing roadmaps for improving weaknesses. Adopting the business-IT maturity model by Pearlson & Saunders (2007) as analytical framework, we synthesize the existing literature, identify levels of cloud computing benefits, and establish propositions for practice in terms of how to realize these benefits.

%X Many scholars are not well trained in conducting a standalone literature review, a scholarly paper that in its entirety summarizes and synthesizes knowledge from a prior body of research. Numerous guides that exist for information systems (IS) research mainly concentrate on only certain parts of the process; few span the entire process. This paper introduces the rigorous, standardized methodology for the systematic literature review (also called systematic review) to IS scholars. This comprehensive guide extends the base methodology from the health sciences and other fields with numerous adaptations to meet the needs of methodologically diverse fields such as IS research, especially those that involve including and synthesizing both quantitative and qualitative studies. Moreover, this guide provides many examples from IS research and provides references to guides with further helpful details for conducting a rigorous and valuable literature review. Although tailored to IS research, it is sufficiently broad to be applicable and valuable to scholars from any social science field.

%X The information systems field needs strong cumulative traditions to advance IS theory building and better explain real-world phenomena. Despite the hegemony of theory in our major journals and major improvements in methodology over the years, the field has yet to achieve strong cumulative traditions beyond a few limited areas. In this paper, we propose a methodology for building such traditions by relying on the framework of external validity that Shadish, Cook, and Campbell (2002) suggest. Our methodology classifies accumulated knowledge into four types, highlights several evolutionary pathways for theory building, and explains how researchers can apply it to extend their own theory. To examine the appropriateness of our typology of accumulated knowledge across the IS and management fields, we conducted a literature review of the empirical research in major IS and management journals over a recent two-year period and coded it according to relevant characteristics of Cronbach’s UTOS (i.e., units, treatments, outcomes, and settings). The technology acceptance model, IS success model, and resource-based view literatures illustrate how to apply the methodology. This evidence leads us to believe that establishing a cumulative tradition is well within the IS community’s grasp.

%X Videoconferencing allows geographically dispersed parties to communicate by simultaneous audio and video transmissions. It is used in a variety of application scenarios with a wide range of coordination needs and efforts, such as private chat, discussion meetings, and negotiation tasks. In particular, in scenarios requiring certain levels of trust and judgement non-verbal communication, cues are highly important for effective communication. Mutual gaze support plays a central role in those high coordination need scenarios but generally lacks adequate technical support from videoconferencing systems. In this paper, we review technical concepts and implementations for mutual gaze support in videoconferencing, classify them, evaluate them according to a defined set of criteria, and give recommendations for future developments. Our review gives decision makers, researchers, and developers a tool to systematically apply and further develop videoconferencing systems in "serious" settings requiring mutual gaze. This should lead to well-informed decisions regarding the use and development of this technology and to a more widespread exploitation of the benefits of videoconferencing in general. For example, if videoconferencing systems supported high-quality mutual gaze in an easy-to-set-up and easy-to-use way, we could hold more effective and efficient recruitment interviews, court hearings, or contract negotiations.

%X The concept of neuro-information systems (neuroIS) has emerged in the IS discipline recently. Since the neuroIS field’s genesis, several neuroIS papers have been published. Investigating empirical papers published in scientific journals and conference proceedings reveals that electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used tool. Thus, considering its relevance in contemporary research and the fact that it will also play a major role in future neuroIS research, we describe EEG from a layman’s perspective. Because previous EEG descriptions in the neuroIS literature have only scantily outlined theoretical and methodological aspects related to this tool, we urgently need a more thorough one. As such, we inform IS scholars about the fundamentals of EEG in a compact way and discuss EEG’s potential for IS research. Based on the knowledge base provided in this paper, IS researchers can make an informed decision about whether EEG could, or should, become part of their toolbox.

%X The prevalence of data mining by businesses and government organizations raises concerns among many individuals about the privacy of their personal data. We address this issue by offering a different perspective that reconciles the conflicting desires of businesses and consumers. We describe privacy, data mining, and their interaction in the larger context, identify the costs and benefits of the uses of data mining, and discuss potential stakeholders found at the intersection of the two subjects. To help synthesize our proposed code of ethical conduct, we examine existing codes of conduct and how they relate to the issue of privacy in the context of data mining with people, processes, and technology. Showing that a uniform code of ethical conduct for online privacy is feasible from both a managerial and ethical perspective, we provide an initial philosophical and principle synthesis that businesses and organizations can tailor for their own specific customers and needs. The developed code of ethical conduct respects consumers’ desire for privacy while allowing businesses to use data mining techniques to elicit information that benefits both the business and the consumer.

%X Internet and World Wide Web technologies provide the infrastructure for the Electronic Commerce (e-Commerce) revolution now taking place.  As a result of these technologies, even the smallest organization can afford to market its wares to hundreds of millions of potential e-Consumers.  However, these technologies also pose threats to the very electronic commerce which they enable.  For managers to strategize and implement e-Commerce effectively in their organizations, these impediments need to be recognized and understood.  While hundreds of articles identify problems with Internet computing or conducting e-Commerce, no unified framework of technological impediments specific to e-Commerce yet exists.    The goal of this paper is to identify the primary technological impediments to e-Commerce.  Six categories of technological impediments have been identified.  Those which appear to pose the greatest threats to the development of e-Commerce are: (1)download delays, (2) limitations in the interface, (3) search problems, (4) inadequate measurement of Web application success, (5) security (real and perceived) weaknesses, and (6) a lack of Internet standards.   Associated costs, threats, and limitations specific to e-Commerce are also identified and implications explored.  The paper concludes with an assessment of ways to mitigate these obstacles, including design choices, workarounds, and emerging technological solutions. A bibliography of 296 relevant trade press articles is included in the appendix.

%X Observers of the Electronic Commerce (EC) landscape often comment on the prospects for disintermediation. Other observers note that the nature of EC will create new kinds of intermediaries, termed "cybermediaries", who would occupy positions in Internet channels between producers and consumers. The word coined to describe this is "reintermediation".  In either case, traditional retailers would be threatened by new EC-enabled competition.  This investigation was launched to predict the occurrence and impact of disintermediation and reintermediation in the US air travel distribution industry.  A group of industry experts was assembled as a Delphi panel and asked to predict the effect that EC would have on the major channel players in each of five major market segments.   The panel forecast that major disintermediation and reintermediation will occur and that there will be a sharp reduction in the number of traditional travel agents five and ten years in the future.  The panel also identified a number of strategic threats and opportunities for the channel players.

%X As the Information Systems (IS) field enters its fourth decade of evolution, the time is right to provide a historiographical examination of this discipline.  Methodological and thematic trends are gauged through a quarterly analysis of 2098 IS articles published in eight leading journals and the ICIS Proceedings in the 12-year period between 1985-1996.  The results of this study show that significant changes occurred in research strategies and themes employed by IS researchers.  Even though a large proportion of IS studies are still non-empirical, we see significant upward trend in the proportion of empirical studies. The reliance on reference disciplines increased significantly over the years. Similarly, we see significantly increasing trends in organizational, environmental and educational themes.  In contrast, technical issues show decreasing trends.  The paper calls for collective efforts to unify knowledge necessary for progress of IS as a scientific field of inquiry.

%X Manheim Auctions, the world's largest auction house, recently developed Manheim Online (MOL) to sell program cars (cars that have been leased or hired) in response to the Japanese company AUCNET's efforts to penetrate the US car auction business. This Internet-based electronic sales system has tremendous potential to change the car auction business. There are over 80,000 used car dealers in the US and Manheim auctions some 6 million cars each year. Trying to leverage its knowledge of the automobile market to provide services to its customers, Manheim developed two other products, Manheim Market Report and AutoConnect. It is also expanding its auction business in Europe. Manheim wants to continue to add value to Manheim Online as a way of discouraging competition and of extending sales through the Internet without cannibalizing Manheim's core business.

%X This study applies the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) to the phenomenon of physician adoption of electronic medical records (EMR) technology. UTAUT integrates eight theories of individual acceptance into one comprehensive model designed to assist in understanding what factors either enable or hinder technology adoption and use. As such, it provides a useful lens through which to view what is currently taking place in the healthcare industry regarding EMR adoption. This is mutually beneficial to both the healthcare and MIS communities, as UTAUT offers valuable practical insight to the healthcare industry in explaining why EMR technology has not been more widely adopted as well as what prescriptions may facilitate future adoption, while offering the MIS community the opportunity to strengthen existing theory through an illustration of its application.

%X In this study we examine the influence of premier information systems research over time to assess the maturity of the Information Systems (IS) field and its impact on subsequent IS and non-IS research. 19,357 citations from the Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) (1982-2004) are attributed to 879 articles published in MIS Quarterly (MISQ), Information Systems Research (ISR), and the IS articles from Management Science (MS) between 1982 and 2004, and this number continues to increase over time. The results suggest that research in premier IS journals has an influence on other disciplines as 7,137 citations come from outside the IS discipline and this number continues to increase over time. Of particular note is the consistent increase over time in citations of premier IS research articles from the management, engineering and physical sciences, organizational behavior, and computer science disciplines. Given recent debates regarding the IT artifact, we also directly test the impact of articles that address the IT artifact and those that do not. We find that articles that directly address the IT artifact are cited significantly more often than those that do not, consistent with arguments made by Benbasat et al. [2003].

%X South Africa has one of the most sophisticated information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructures in Africa, and was one of the early adopters of the Internet on the continent. This paper describes a longitudinal analysis of Internet diffusion in South Africa over the period 1994 to 2004 by making use of the Global Diffusion of the Internet (GDI) framework. It also analyses the determinants of further diffusion. The analysis shows that in 2004, at the end of its first decade of democracy, less than 10 percent of the population accessed the Internet despite its relatively wide geographic dispersion. Across the education, commercial, health, and public sectors the Internet had been largely embraced, with potential for further diffusion. The underlying national Internet connectivity infrastructure was well established. Strong competition existed between Internet service providers despite a monopoly on fixed-line telecommunications provision for much of the period. The Internet was being used for sophisticated applications in several sectors. The overall analysis reflected South Africa's reputation as having one of the most developed ICT sectors in Africa. The findings are perhaps also a reflection of its status as a middle-income developing country. After major growth in the 1990s, from 2000 to 2004 growth declined significantly. Reasons identified included the monopoly telecommunications environment over much of the period, restrictive regulation, delayed implementation of policies, and the socio-economic divide in the nation. Telecommunications policy directives announced at the end of 2004 helped in reversing the trend of stagnation that had set in.

%X Action research is particularly valuable for its ability to inform theory while making a practical difference. Special issues of MISQ in 2004 and Information Technology and People in 2001 called attention both to action research and research methodology. Yet action research is not widely disseminated across the information systems discipline.  The purpose of this tutorial is to advance information systems action research and serve researchers, practitioners, and reviewers by addressing the dissemination problem. We consider how an action research project and the resulting article can widen its appeal to information systems scholars in two ways. First, by clarifying the information systems research paradigm vocabulary of epistemology, methodology, and the action research approach. And second, we outline an article structure more familiar to positivist researchers, thereby creating a bridge among IS scholars to a largely positivist audience. This tutorial is based on the experiences of the authors as information systems action researchers.

%X Research productivity is one means by which academic units attain legitimacy within their institutional milieu and make their case for resources.  Journal quality assessment is an important component for assessing faculty research productivity.  We introduce the Author Affiliation Index (AAI), a simple method for assessing journal quality, to the IS domain. Essentially, the AAI of a journal is the percentage of academic authors publishing in that journal who are affiliated with a base set of high-quality academic institutions. Besides explaining the AAI, we demonstrate its use with a set of well-known IS journals, discuss its rankings vis-à-vis those resulting from other methods, and provide an example of how the basic AAI approach can be modified by changing the base school set that is used to define journal quality.  The AAI has a number of advantages.  First, it is a simple, low cost and transparent method for assessing any journal given a base school set.  Second, it provides a consistent ranking of journals, particularly of those beyond the top consensus journals where less consistency is achieved with other measures.  Third, it enables new journals to be rapidly assessed against more established ones without the lags or costs of other measures.  The AAI provides another indicator of journal quality that is different from surveys and citation analyses.

%X An analysis of 18,854 editorial positions on IS journals was undertaken to examine the perceived gender balance of those positions as an indication of their contribution towards a positive role model for females considering an IS academic career. The nature and extent of perceived gender balance is examined in terms of overall composition of editorial positions, journal prestige and the specific area within IS covered by a journal. The results indicate that perceived gender balance of editorial positions reflects that of ICT academia generally, and that female representation appears to be concentrated in journals covering areas that are traditionally seen as female occupations, e.g., health, education, librarianship. As such, little or no encouragement is given to females considering an IS academic career.

The panel titled, "Social Activism in IS Research: Making the World a Better Place," was organized to question whether and how Information System (IS) research is making tangible impacts to our society. More specifically, each panelist was asked to address: (1) How can IS research, and researchers, make contributions to underdeveloped societies and underserved communities?; and (2) How can IS researchers learn from the particularities of these communities to inform better research, teaching, and service? While each panel member had different perspectives to offer in relation to these two questions, all agreed that IS academe needs to raise its awareness and efforts considerably with a view to address the needs of underserved communities.

IT outsourcing, often to overseas locations, appears to have accomplished efficiency improvements. However, firms increasingly employ global sourcing of IT services for other purposes, such as to broaden the scope of provided services and for strategic considerations. Given the complexities of emergent forms of global IT sourcing - away from arm's length transactions and toward highly integrated relationships - the purpose of this panel, originally presented at the 2006 International Conference on Information Systems, was to shed light on the issue of global sourcing of IT services by examining three interrelated questions: 1) Is this more about efficiency or strategic considerations? 2) What new conceptual frameworks and theory bases are appropriate for studies of global IT sourcing? and 3) What skills are required of managers and what should we be teaching our students?

%X The Internet is democratizing commerce by turning economic models that were based on a strict separation between providers and consumers into models where this distinction is increasingly blurred.  This implies significant opportunities and challenges for organizations, particularly with respect to the role that their customers play in the generation of economic value. Are customers partners or competitors? While firms typically strive to implement business models that leverage the customers as a resource (i.e., customer co-production), models in which customers are competitors (i.e., peer production) are frequently met with attempts to co-opt these customers (i.e., hybrid co-production).  The purpose of this panel, presented at the 2006 International Conference on Information Systems, is to explore the range of Internet-enabled co-production models (i.e., customer and hybrid co-production) and the opportunities and challenges that they present for firms.

%X This study identifies the significant factors affecting Internet growth levels at an early stage of growth in African nations. The average growth levels of Internet users for 1995 and 2003 are calculated and the associations between Internet growth level and several types of factors such as econ¬omic, educational, institutional, infrastructural, innovation-related, and environmental factors are examined. Human development, higher education, technology availability, and computer growth levels explain more than 84 percent of the variance in African Internet growth levels. When compared to non-African nations, Africa lacks the influence of institutional variables. Compared with a set of economically similar developing nations (bas¬ed on similar GDP per capita and income inequality levels), Africa has different Internet growth levels, even though the number of Internet hosts per 1,000 and delays in starting Internet diffusion are similar. These differences are probably due to lack of education, human development, infrastructural and environmental variables.

%X Enterprise systems (ES) are industry-specific, customizable software packages that integrate information and business process in organizations. Despite the advantages associated with implementing ES, their success has been mixed. This has attracted the interest of researchers and resulted in a proliferation of literature on implementation. However, the extant ES studies lack a theoretical framework for the examination of ES use and its implications for change in organizations. We seek to bridge this research gap by proposing a theoretical framework for change induced through ES use. This paper contributes to theory in two areas. First, by analytically separating the notions of structure, institution, and organization, we illustrate a consistent application of Giddens' structuration theory to ES use. Second, we develop a structurational model of ES-induced change that explicates the relationship between specific characteristics of ES and the nature of change occasioned through their use by human agents within a historically shaped organizational context. Towards this objective, we distinguish ES from other information systems. Implications for practitioners and researchers are presented.

%X The UTAUT (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology), a unified model of the acceptance of technology by workers in the United States, explains individual acceptance and usage decisions of a technology in organizations (R2 up to 70 percent); its usefulness, however, has not been tested in settings outside the U.S. Other models of technology use, such as the Technology Acceptance Model, have been predictive within the U.S., but have been found to be less predictive when tested in countries outside the U.S., such as Switzerland, Japan, Arabic countries, and Hong Kong, suggesting that culture may play a significant role in Information Technology (IT) usage and adoption. No clear relationships, however, have been established between cultural variables and IT adoption factors. The UTAUT model includes social influence as a factor that explains some of the variance in users' acceptance of technology. One dimension of the social influence factor is culture. This study examines the effect of culture through the social influence variable of the UTAUT model on user acceptance of Prepayment Metering Systems - an Information Technology-based innovation in India. The findings indicate that social influence, along with performance expectancy and effort expectancy (R2 = 72 percent), is a significant factor influencing consumers' intention to use the Prepayment Metering Systems. Social influence represents societal pressure on users to engage in a certain behavior. This social pressure for an individual to perform a behavior varies by culture. Our study confirms our proposition that the social influence based in culture will provide additional explanatory power concerning consumers' intention to use a technology.

%X Over the years, interpretivism has been gradually gaining ground in Information Systems (IS) research.   At the heart of this interpretivist movement (which has helped to advance its cause) is a belief in theoretical and methodological pluralism.  Against this backdrop, the purpose of this paper is to reflect on how interpretive IS researchers can move beyond theoretical and methodological pluralism to leverage the inherent strengths of the interpretivist paradigm.  In this regard, we note that there has been little discussion in IS literature about how interpretive researchers can actively seek to purposefully leverage the respective strengths of the informing theoretical perspective and the chosen strategy of inquiry throughout the research process while being fully cognizant of the ensuing criteria for ensuring trustworthiness of the study.   To illustrate the importance of achieving such leverage in interpretive IS research, we use the example of the ethnographic approach being informed by symbolic interactionism.   At the same time, we explicate how the analytical edge of the constant comparative technique from grounded theory can enhance this leverage.  We contend that this paper's contribution has value as it provides a starting point for interested researchers to apply this approach to other combinations of theoretical perspectives and strategies of inquiry.

%X One of the main challenges of exchanging patient care records between heterogeneous systems is the difficulty in overcoming semantic differences between them. This is further exacerbated by the lack of standardization in messaging protocols. As a solution to this problem, multiple ideas and standards have been proposed for exchanging clinical and administrative data in the healthcare area. However, most of these methods place some restrictions on the platform, standard or format, of the data. This paper proposes a context-specific, mediating schema-based architecture that enhances the transfer of electronic patient care records between healthcare information systems by using a reusable and portable model. The main contribution of this approach is its adaptability to a variety of schemas for the source and target systems.

%X This paper details the development of a Masters in Health Informatics (MHI) program. It traces the design from conception through environmental scanning and curriculum development and into survey validation. One of the underlying characteristics identified in the analysis of other programs was that there seemed to be two subgroups or themes in health informatics programs: clinical and health administrative foci. A draft curriculum addressing the interest of both subgroups was developed, and a focus group of local health care industry professionals was conducted. The draft curriculum was the basis for surveys targeting the two potential subgroups. In addition to validating the interest in a masters program from both groups, the data was analyzed for potential differences between the two groups. These results confirmed the initial premise that a well-designed health informatics curriculum must address both the clinical and healthcare administration subgroups.

%X Understanding the managerial influence on user beliefs of information technology (IT) has been an important concern to the IT adoption research. Our study contributes by examining relationships between managers' leadership behavior and user technology beliefs. Drawing on the transformational leadership theory [Bass 1985], we develop a research model comparing the effect of leadership behaviors of two managerial roles - project champions and direct managers - on user technology beliefs. Our cross-sectional survey across 138 users in five organizations suggests that project champions and direct managers' leadership behaviors exercise different influences on users' technology beliefs. Implications of this study on research and practice are discussed.

%X This article inductively examines the question of the IS field's core. We argue that as a socially constructed field, the core aspects of IS can be identified from the work conducted and published by members of IS community. The abstracts (including titles) of 1,197 IS studies in three premier IS journals for the past 26 years were examined to identify the core of the field and explore its evolving nature with help of a neural network software as the analysis tool. The field, contextual, transitory, and evolving core of IS are identified through the analysis of 267,034 words in the knowledge base constructed. The results show both stability and evolution of the core of IS field. The three journals examined show sufficient commonality on core of the field, with slightly different preferences for research topics and methods. Given the diverse nature of the IS field, we believe that such a retrospective and descriptive study can document evidence of the "core" and facilitate a better understanding of the evolution of the field.

%X In the age of life-long learning and increased competition for time, motivation becomes a salient issue. Students need to be more intrinsically motivated in the absence of more formal structure. This is especially true in online learning environments where direct instructor influence is mitigated. Online learning environments typically embrace many choices in ways in which learning material is presented and interaction with students is supported in both individual and collaborative contexts. As such, it is imperative that we better understand the implications of various learning activities and associated technologies on aspects of intrinsic motivation in e-learning. In this paper we examine these effects through qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with students in an online MBA program. Results encourage use of a pedagogically driven portfolio of learning activities supported by well-selected and integrated audio, video, and data technologies. Extension to use of mobile devices in ubiquitous e-learning contexts is explored.

%X Firms are under increasing regulatory pressures to protect consumers’ confidential information. The focus of this article is to examine the impact of federal and state breach notification laws in coaxing organizations to improve security of customers’ confidential information. Specifically, we use event-study methodology to examine the impact of security breach announcements on the market value of firms during the period before and after the enactment of this legislation. Our results show that the negative impacts of security breach announcements on stock prices have been reduced significantly after the enactment of federal and state security breach notification laws.

%X Software projects often do not meet their scheduling and budgeting targets. Inaccurate estimates are often responsible for this mismatch. This study investigates extant research on factors that affect accuracy of software development effort estimation. The purpose is to synthesize existing knowledge, propose directions for future research, and improve estimation accuracy in practice. A systematic mapping study (a comprehensive review of existing research) is conducted to identify such factors and their impact on estimation accuracy. Thirty-two factors assigned to four categories (estimation process, estimator’s characteristics, project to be estimated, and external context) are identified in a variety of research studies. Although the significant impact of several factors has been shown, results are limited by the lack of insight into the extent of these impacts. Our results imply a shift in research focus and design to gather more in-depth insights. Moreover, our results emphasize the need to argue for specific design decisions to enable a better understanding of possible influences of the study design on the credibility of the results. For software developers, our results provide a useful map to check the assumptions that undergird their estimates, to build comprehensive experience databases, and to adequately staff design projects.

%X This article presents the results of an empirical evaluation of the use of a real-world case study, based on an actual Big Four consulting engagement, to teach information systems and accounting courses. While alternative approaches for adopting the case are suggested, we used the case study in an undergraduate case competition judged by Big Four partners to enhance realism. Students, working in teams, assumed the role of consultants and defended their recommendations involving the assessment of key business process controls within the final phase of ERP implementation. In this process, students are expected to benefit by understanding the relationship between information systems and accounting in an ERP implementation project; learning to work more effectively in teams; and improving analytical, oral, and written communication skills. Evaluation of the use of the case study in an undergraduate case competition, judged by Big Four partners, shows that the students generally agreed that they had attained these benefits. The actual case materials, questions with suggested solutions, case competition rules and procedures, judges’ assessment form, and the winning team’s written report and PowerPoint presentation slides are provided.

%X With in-memory technology, all data and applications are kept in the computer’s main memory to avoid expensive mechanical hard-drive I/O access, reduce latency times, and increase the ability to process large volumes of data or complex data. In this “innovation and novel concepts” article, we discuss how in-memory technology may create business value. Based on our experiences in collaborating with the Hilti Corporation, one of the first adopters of SAP’s in-memory technology appliance (SAP HANA), we describe and discuss illustrative application scenarios that are made possible through the increased computing power offered by in-memory technology. Based on these scenarios, we identify principles of value creation through in-memory technology: the first-order effects of reduced latency times and increased ability to process large volumes of complex data (big data processing) that lead to the second-order effects of advanced business analytics and the convergence of OLTP and OLAP that themselves lead to business value through improved organizational performance.

%X Process models are used to convey semantics about business operations that are to be supported by an information system. A wide variety of professionals is targeted to use such models, including people who have little modeling or domain expertise. We identify important user characteristics that influence the comprehension of process models. Through a free simulation experiment, we provide evidence that selected cognitive abilities, learning style, and learning strategy influence the development of process model comprehension. These insights draw attention to the importance of research that views process model comprehension as an emergent learning process rather than as an attribute of the models as objects. Based on our findings, we identify a set of organizational intervention strategies that can lead to more successful process modeling workshops.

%X Although experiments are considered a valid scientific method for evaluating the outcome of design science research (DSR), only minimal procedural guidelines or standards exist that help researchers in the setup and conduct. To take advantage of and encourage researchers to include design experiments as an inherent part of their build and test cycle, this study proposes a set of guidelines. In order to get a broad overview of how researchers currently apply the experimental method in DSR and to detect potential drawbacks, an extensive review of the extant literature was conducted. On this basis, we propose an evaluation framework that complements the general design science research guidelines of Hevner and colleagues. The purpose of this framework is to assist researchers, reviewers, editors, and readers in understanding possible pitfalls as well as to ask the right questions which need to be answered in the conduct of design experiments.

%X Teaching cases can be instrumental in developing skills of critical analysis, problem solving and strategic thinking in students, especially in specific contexts such as Information Systems (IS). While cases are widely used in the curricula of graduate and undergraduate programs in developed countries, there is a lack of teaching cases set in developing countries, particularly in the area of information and communication technology for development (ICT4D). In this paper, we address this gap by telling the story of the Nepal Wireless Networking Project (NWNP) and its effort to connect villages in remote areas of Nepal to the outside world. Despite lack of access to proper equipment, lack of technical competence and the difficult terrain in the Himalayan mountains, Mahabir Pun, the initiator of NWNP, succeeded in bringing Internet access to these villages, contributing to improvements in education, health services and income generating activities. The case describes the development of NWNP from inception until today, the stakeholders involved, services provided, current challenges and ideas for future improvements. Furthermore the case illustrates the importance of the champion, the process of getting commitment important stakeholders, the importance of contextual understanding, and the challenges while scaling up from pilot projects to wider implementations in the context of developing countries.

%X The quality and success of scholarly work depends in large measure on the quality of the literature review process. This paper advances conceptual understanding of the literature review process and extends earlier guidelines on literature reviews. It proposes a hermeneutic framework that integrates the analysis and interpretation of literature and the search for literature. This hermeneutic framework describes the literature review process as fundamentally a process of developing understanding that is iterative in nature. Using the hermeneutic circle it describes the literature review process as being constituted by literature searching, classifying and mapping, critical assessment, and argument development. The hermeneutic approach emphasizes continuous engagement with and gradual development of a body of literature during which increased understanding and insights are developed. The paper contributes to better understanding of the literature review process and provides guidelines to assist researchers in conducting high quality reviews. Approaches for efficient searching are included in an Appendix.

However, it is not clear if increasingly advanced analytical capabilities create opportunities for radical change in business or just represent an incremental improvement to existing systems. What are the key questions that researchers should be focusing on to improve our understanding of analytics? And are Information Systems (IS) programs teaching students the right things to be successful in this environment? This panel at International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS) 2012 took stock of technological possibilities, practical experience and leading research to assess the current state and future direction of business analytics. In doing so, it brought together senior researchers and industry representatives to share the leading challenges, opportunities and good practice that they see.

%X Patient-centered e-health (PCEH) is an increasingly important part of health information technology. Yet the literature in this area is mainly descriptive and atheoretical, which greatly limits opportunities for research advancement. This observation motivated us to undertake a program to explore and identify essential components that can underpin development of a guiding theory of PCEH (i.e., a set of robust constructs and relationships that are generalizable and prescriptive across diverse PCEH services). Our work builds upon the proposition that benefits of PCEH can be increased by incorporating three essential characteristics: patient-focus, patient-activity, and patient-empowerment. We conduct a literature review of e-health research published between 2007 and 2011 to assess the relevance of these characteristics to the underlying domain and their relationships to one another. The results indicate the three characteristics are generalizable to the existing PCEH research literature, are abstract across place and time, and exhibit substantial interrelationships. These findings are encouraging to further development of a guiding theory of PCEH.

%X Health IT applications today generally incorporate patients as passive users or consumers of information rather than active individuals who, in concert with their providers, are motivated and jointly responsible for their own good health. This article uses the healthcare value chain concept [Porter and Teisberg, 2006] as a framework to identify gaps in patient-centered e-health applications. While patient diversity poses challenges similar to consumer diversity for application design, consumer-centric design is limiting for patient-centered e-health because patients should not simply consume health care; they need to interact at multiple stages, alter their behaviors, and actively participate. This article raises critical research questions specific to this challenge. It defines a new term, “healthicant,” to motivate a research focus on technology-enabled applications that support individuals responsible for their own health and well-being, and who seek appropriate assistance as needed to prevent, diagnose, prepare, intervene, rehabilitate, monitor, and manage their health throughout their lifetime. The article contrasts the objectives of healthicants with both healthcare providers (for whom most health IT has been created) and more passive patients (for whom current “patient-centered” applications are evolving), in order to identify important gaps today. These include systems that support healthicant motivation, measurement, analysis, data mining, real-time personalized feedback, and multidirectional communication.

%X Patient-centered e-health (PCEH) represents a fascinating area of digitized stakeholder interactions characterized by complex information flows, shared decision making, co-created value, and mutual interest in improving health outcomes. Such a context lies in contrast to often contentious firm-consumer relationships characterized by self-interest, surplus maximization (from both producer and consumer sides), and consumer segmentation. This article suggests that PCEH is an ideal context in which to study the emerging class of information systems that include consumers as empowered influencers, stakeholders, and decision makers, rather than only “purchasers” on the other side of the exchange relationship or “mandated” users in the enterprise context. The PCEH context is proposed as an enormous research opportunity that may significantly contribute to expanding information systems research and theory.

%X Drawing on lessons learned from a mixed-methods research project, we illustrate how mixed research approaches are fruitful in studying the complexities and interactions inherent in IS phenomena, which is particularly relevant when one investigates relatively new and “messy” phenomena in that many opportunities for errors and omissions can arise. Mixed-methods research designs can also prove to be valuable in exploratory or new areas of research and provide empirical evidence from multiple sources and types of data that one can truly triangulate. In this paper, we discuss the risks associated with using a specific mixed-methods research strategy (i.e., embedded mixed-methods design) and the practical remedies we used to address them. This discussion provides operational guidance to researchers interested in adopting mixed research designs to study emergent IS phenomena.

%X Drawing on notions of power and the social construction of risk, we build new theory to understand the persistence of shadow systems in organizations. From a single case study in a mid-sized savings bank, we derive two feedback cycles that concern shifting power relations between business units and central IT associated with shadow systems. A distant business-IT relationship and changing business needs can create repeated cost and time pressures that make business units draw on shadow systems. The perception of risk can trigger an opposing power shift back through the decommissioning and recentralization of shadow systems. However, empirical findings suggest that the weakening tendency of formal risk-management programs may not be sufficient to stop the shadow systems cycle spinning if they fail to address the underlying causes for the emergence of shadow systems. These findings highlight long-term dynamics associated with shadow systems and pose “risk” as a power-shifting construct.

%X Social media has quickly become a dominant mode of professional and personal communication. Unfortunately, groups who intend to perform illegal and/or harmful activities (such as gangs, criminal groups, and terrorist groups) also use it. These covert networks use social media to foster membership, communicate among followers and non-followers, and obtain ideological and financial support. This exploitation of social media has serious political, cultural, and societal repercussions that go beyond stolen identities, hacked systems, or loss of productivity. There are literal life-and-death consequences of the actions of the groups behind these covert networks. However, through tracking and analyzing social media content, government agencies (in particular those in the intelligence community) can mitigate this threat by uncovering these covert networks, their communication, and their plans. This paper introduces common social media analysis techniques and the current approaches of analyzing covert networks. A case study of the Syrian conflict, with particular attention on ISIS, highlights this exploitation and the process of using social media analysis for intelligence gathering. The results of the case study show that covert networks are resilient and continually adapt their social media use and presence to stay ahead of the intelligence community.

Finally, we elaborate on some hard questions about whether the current conference model is fit for purpose and consider alternative models for our high-quality conference.

%X From the time of the first ICIS conference in 1980, the debate over the identity of IS research continues to flare. Accompanying this debate is an endless quest for "the core" of the IS field and its boundaries, as well as the identification and articulation of its reference disciplines and research methods. This debate most recently crystallized in the dialectic between the Benbasat-Zmud-Weber position around narrowing the field to center around the core of "the IS artifact" --- and the Alter position around broadening the field to be a work-centered systemic interconnected view.  This paper argues that there is nothing inherently wrong with either of these two perspectives, but that they are just alternative models of reality which bring particular central features of phenomena to the foreground and hide other features.  The paper further argues that there is at least a third critical perspective that can be equally argued for. It characterizes these three perspectives of IS identity as connection, immersion, and fusion, and articulates their commonalities and distinctions. Like the "Three Faces of Eve" in the classic 1957 Hitchcock movie thriller, each of these faces of IS identity reveals particular aspects of the IS persona.  This paper contends that it may be time for a natural shift of emphasis from the Connection view to the Immersion View to the Fusion view as IT continues to morph and augment its capabilities. The paper explains the differences and similarities among the three views, and articulates each of them. The Fusion view is one that is not yet apparent in the IS field. This paper alerts the IS scholarly community to pay attention to it, and suggests ways of doing that.

%X Much recent debate focuses on the nature of information systems as an academic endeavour and whether it constitutes a single, coherent subject discipline in its own right. This paper comments particularly on the recent paper by Benbasat and Zmud [2003] that proposes an IT artifact model to provide an integrative theme for IS research, and the response by Alter [2003] who presents an alternative paradigm that emphasizes the importance of systems. The approach taken here is to define the terminology of IS and put it into a management context which is implicit in most IS research but is often overlooked in the debates on the nature of academic IS research. It is proposed that a multidisciplinary approach to IS research is the most appropriate way of conceptualizing IS problems, academic research, and business practice, and that the integrating themes arise from the terms 'information' and 'systems' rather than from the technology. A multidisciplinary view of IS has different implications for identifying appropriate research problems, research design, publication and dissemination, and for the development of professional bodies than the IT artifact philosophy. It has some similarities to the systems model proposed by Alter and takes this concept further to stress that the IS research field can make a claim not only to systems but to much broader core disciplines in management because of the ubiquitous nature of not only IT, but also because of the central role that information plays in the co-ordination of economic activity in business enterprises. To support the argument, examples of historical IS research are outlined and the importance of earlier multidisciplinary research areas is described, particularly the antecedents of OR research practice in the UK. Finally some tentative ideas on future IS research and practice are outlined.

%X Debates about the core and the scope of the IS field and about whether the core and scope are related to a crisis in the field have smoldered for many years. This article is a response to ten articles submitted by members of the CAIS Editorial Board who accepted an invitation to contribute to a debate about the core and scope of the IS field. Those articles were written as responses to Benbasat and Zmud's [2003] article "The Identity Crisis Within the IS Discipline: Defining and Communicating the Discipline's Core Properties" and my rebuttal [Alter 2003b] entitled "Sidestepping the IT Artifact, Scrapping the IS Silo, and Laying Claim to "Systems in Organizations."  The present  article is organized around excerpts from the ten articles related to the major topics they address as a group: -What are the core and scope of the IS field? -Is "the IT artifact" a meaningful concept? -Who is the customer of IS research? -Do we believe the IS discipline is having an identity crisis?   -How do institutional issues shape the IS field? -What if we followed Benbasat and Zmud's suggestions? The conclusion attempts to sort out various views of the core, scope, and (possible) crisis of the IS field by identifying major products and major customers of the academic IS field and asking which customers are interested in which products.  If a crisis exists, it is about the perceptions of certain customers, but not others, and may be only tangentially related to issues about the core or scope of the IS field. On the other hand, the core and scope of the IS field do have implications for the value of the products it produces and for its long-term ability to serve all of its major customers.

%X Since the 1980s, Solectron evolved as a contract provider of manufacturing, distribution, product design, and full-service supply chain integration to many Fortune 500 companies in the telecommunications, electronics, and computer industries.  In order to achieve this set of capabilities, Solectron established a tightly coupled set of collaborative relationships with supply chain participants- including both suppliers and customers.  This action research study explores Solectron's data warehousing implementation and outsourcing experiences to support the organization's strategic direction.  We uncover the absence of new set of critical pre-implementation performance metrics for managers and researchers to consider under conditions of outsourcing; multiple, simultaneous projects; and lack of IT internal expertise. Thus, our research offers hypotheses that can be further tested by future research.

%X Object-oriented systems development (OOSD) is viewed by many as the best available solution to the ongoing "software crisis." However, some caution that OOSD is so complex that it may never become a mainstream methodology. To settle the controversy requires high-quality empirical evidence. This paper surveys the most rigorous research on OOSD available over the past decade. A review of these empirical studies indicates that the weight of the evidence tends to slightly favor OOSD, although most studies fail to build on a theoretical foundation, many suffer from inadequate experimental designs, and some draw highly questionable conclusions from the evidence. This set of conditions points to the need for additional, higher quality research to build a better case either for or against OOSD.

%X The amount of information being collected and stored electronically continues to increase as does the need to share this data among disparate applications and non-compatible computer systems.  The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) was introduced to meet this challenge by providing a standardized way to exchange data.  XML is being adopted rapidly, and is positioned to thrive in the electronic marketplace.  A main premise behind Microsoft's .Net strategy and the recent release of Sun's J2EE platform is the belief that XML marks a turning point in the evolution of the Internet and computing architectures.  The power behind XML is its simplicity; however there is still much confusion about this technology.  XML will evolve as its structure, its strengths, its weaknesses, and how it can be used more effectively are better understood.   This paper includes an overview of XML and XML specifications and corresponding components, technical implementation requirements, the development of schemas for defining industry standard data definitions, a scenario employing XML technologies, and a discussion of the potential impact of XML on information systems.

%X Business and information systems (IS) executives continue to grapple with issues of risk and uncertainty in evaluating investments in information technology (IT). Despite the use of net present value (NPV) and other investment appraisal techniques, executives are often forced to rely on instinct when finalizing IT investment decisions. Recognizing the shortcomings of NPV, real options analysis has been suggested as an alternative approach, one that considers the risks associated with an investment while recognizing the ability of corporations to defer an investment until a later period or to make a partial investment instead. Responding to a growing interest in real options analysis among the IS community, a debate involving four prominent researchers was convened at the 2001 International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS). In addition to offering a tutorial overview of real options, the goal of the debate was to assess the state of research in this area and to identify avenues for future research. This paper describes the outcomes of the debate, culminating in a series of research questions and topics that set the stage for future research in IT and real options analysis. A transcript of the debate and an overview of real options analysis are included as appendices.

%X The term enterprise application integration (EAI) refers to the plans, methods, and tools aimed at modernizing, consolidating, integrating and coordinating the computer applications within an enterprise. The need to integrate across applications is being driven by customer demand for access to information and the desire of the business for a single point of contact with their customer base. The challenges are significant because of the variety of technologies in need of integration and because integration cuts across lines of business. This paper distinguishes among four different (but related) targets of EAI: Data-level integration Application-level integration Process-level integration Inter-organizational-level integration The paper then discusses the technologies that assist with this integration (the "EAI toolkit") under the following categories: Asynchronous Event/Message Transport Transformation Engines Integration Brokers Business Process Management Frameworks The paper concludes by outlining six key strategies for managing EAI suggested by a group of senior IT managers from leading-edge firms.

Even though thirty-eight states reported having a strategic information technology plan in place and ten reported having a plan in progress; analysis of the data shows that the executive and legislative or highest levels of state government are "not involved" in SISP. A lack of integrated statewide governmental strategic information systems planning (SISP) suggests that SISP as defined by private sector models may not be accomplished easily in the public sector. Significant differences in the process of setting organizational objectives, planning horizons, and stakeholder involvement are barriers to public sector application of private sector SISP models which few states seem to have overcome.

%X The IS Bibliographic Repository (ISBIB), a central repository of Information Systems citations and author information, is a shared resource for research and researcher assessment that can support multiple streams of research.  The goal of the repository is to capture research citations and other valuable information from all sub-cultures and disciplines within the international IS community, thereby providing a balanced perspective on the state of art in IS research.  This repository should lead to a better understanding on the scope and objectives of IS research in general.    The repository also aims to be an unbiased data source for bibliometric research, and studies on IS research methods and processes. It currently holds systematic information about 82 journals.  In the spirit of community development, the repository is available to the entire IS community, free of charge.   This article describes the current state of the repository and invites readers to use it both for their own research and for bibliometric analysis.  Because the repository is intended to be a reflection of the global IS community, the authors, who are also its maintainers, encourage IS researchers and journal editors to provide bibliographic information to extend the repository's usefulness.

%X New mobile devices, combined with content digitization, promise the creation of a vast global network that will have enormous and far-reaching impacts on how we work and live. Who will benefit from this technology, where its real opportunities lie, and how it will impact our organizations and our personal lives is not yet clear. We know that changes will occur and that these impacts will likely vary by firm, industry, and segment of society. What we don't know is how and when these changes will happen. This uncertainty leaves business with the challenge of navigating between the opportunities presented by the new capabilities offered by mobile technology and the risks of being in the wrong place at the wrong time as their business ecosystem alters. This paper is a tutorial for both the IS practitioner and the IS academic. It presents the issues faced in applying wireless technology in business and suggests areas in which research might be fruitful. It concludes that mobile computing is a new and unstable technology that potentially can change much about how organizations work. However, the uncertainty surrounding mobile computing can make decision-making a challenge for many senior executives who would like to see a clear business case for their investment. Unfortunately, this goal is not always possible. Instead, executives must learn to recognize a variety of options for the future and manage these effectively and dynamically while keeping a close eye on the value proposition.

%X Work exhaustion of information technology (IT) professionals is a serious concern. This study offers a unique perspective on IT professional work exhaustion by drawing on two theoretical domains: emotional labor and conflict management. Emotional labor theory is concerned with employee’s display of emotion in the workplace while conflict management theory addresses one’s preferred style when conflict arises. This study identifies links between the ways in which one responds to conflict situations and the way in which one monitors and controls emotional displays. The experience of conflict tends to generate negative emotions while display rules govern appropriate emotional demeanors in the workplace. The findings suggest that the perception of display rules influences conflict management styles. Furthermore, conflict management styles influence the use of strategies of deep acting and surface acting which have differential relationships with work exhaustion.

%X Crowdfunding is a rapidly growing technology-enabled process that has the potential to disrupt the capital market space. In order for this process to work efficiently, it is important to clarify the issues surrounding the phenomenon from the founders’, the backers’, and the technology providers’ viewpoints. We begin with an ecosystem view to understand the stakeholders and their roles in the crowdfunding process. We review the literature with a focus on how current research fits into the overall crowdfunding phenomenon. Guided by typology and classification research approaches, we identify six distinct crowdfunding business models: private equity, royalty, microfinance, peer-to-peer lending, rewards, and donation. Based on identified roles and crowdfunding business models, we propose a conceptual research framework. We conclude by showing how current research fits into our proposed framework and offer suggestions for future research directions.

%X Driven by advances in information and communication technology, end users nowadays operate extensive information systems to support all kinds of private and professional activities. Previous IS research has coined various terms to refer to this rather new phenomenon. Some scholars call it individualization in IS; others refer to it as consumerization of IT. While scholars still struggle to agree on a common conceptualization and terminology, it is clear that particular aspects of this new phenomenon have already been addressed by previous work on technology acceptance, satisfaction, or technology diffusion. However, these previous findings do not form a distinct and integrated body of knowledge because no one has yet associated them with the phenomenon of individualization. To address this gap, we suggest an integrated, yet generic, conceptualization of individualization in form of a meta-theory. Based on the key entities and relations of the meta-theory, we conduct a structured literature review to identify pre-existing IS contributions to the individualization phenomenon, which help explain the phenomenon of individualization in IS. Furthermore, we analyze the identified literature for gaps in understanding the phenomenon and outline future research opportunities.

%X Hackers, malicious users, system malfunctions, and other incidents can disrupt organizational IS and cause severe organizational losses or even impact societies as a whole. In this paper, I review interdisciplinary literature on business continuity from an information systems (IS) perspective to increase understanding on how organizations can prepare for and respond to incidents. I use a narrative review approach with descriptive elements to review 83 peer-reviewed papers published between 2000-2012 across a wide array of journals and disciplines. I identify themes across the past contributions, join the currently isolated streams of literature under a concept of IS continuity, and identify research gaps in the current knowledge. The results suggest that one can understand past contributions in terms of four themes that emerged from the literature: (1) social aspects as IS continuity enabler, (2) technology as IS continuity enabler, (3) salience of IS continuity, and (4) models that improve IS continuity. To move toward an integration of the past research, and to pinpoint research gaps, I present an integrative framework. Further, the research contributes to forming an IS continuity community to facilitate cooperation and communications among scholars sharing a common interest.

%X There has been a flowering of scholarly interest in the literature review as a research method in the information systems discipline. We feel privileged to contribute to this conversation and introduce the work of the authors represented in this special issue. Some of the highlights include three new methods for conducting literature analysis and guidelines, tutorials, and approaches for coping with some of the challenges involved in carrying out a literature review. Of the three “new method” papers, one (ontological meta-analysis and synthesis) is entirely new, and two (stylized facts and critical discourse analysis) are novel in the information systems context. The other four paper address more general issues: the challenges of effective search strategies when confronted with the burgeoning volume of research available, a detailed tool-supported approach for conducting a rigorous review, a detailed tutorial for conducting a qualitative literature review, and a discussion of quality issues. Collectively, the papers place emphasis beyond the traditional “narrative synthesis” on the importance of selecting the appropriate approach for the research context and the importance of attention to quality and transparency at all stages of the process, regardless of which approach is adopted.

%X Given that the synthesis of cumulated knowledge is an essential condition for any field to grow and develop, we believe that the enhanced role of IS reviews requires that this expository form be given careful scrutiny. Over the past decade, several senior scholars have made calls for more review papers in our field. While the number of IS review papers has substantially increased in recent years, no prior research has attempted to develop a general framework to conduct and evaluate the rigor of standalone reviews. In this paper, we fill this gap. More precisely, we present a set of guidelines for guiding and evaluating IS literature reviews and specify to which review types they apply. To do so, we first distinguish between four broad categories of review papers and then propose a set of guidelines that are grouped according to the generic phases and steps of the review process. We hope our work will serve as a valuable source for those conducting, evaluating, and/or interpreting reviews in our field.

%X We present ontological meta-analysis and synthesis as a method for reviewing, mapping, and visualizing the research literature in a domain cumulatively, logically, systematically, and systemically. The method highlights a domain’s bright spots that have been heavily studied, the light spots that have been lightly studied, the blind spots that have been overlooked, and the blank spots that have not been studied. It highlights the biases in a domain’s research; the research can then be realigned to make it stronger and more effective. We illustrate the method using the emerging domain of public health informatics (PHI). We present an ontological framework for the domain, map the literature onto the framework, and highlight its bright, light, and blind/blank spots. We also present detailed analyses using the ontological maps of dyads and triads. We conclude by discussing how (a) the results can be used to realign PHI research, and (b) the method can be used in other information systems domains.

%X It is important for researchers to efficiently conduct quality literature studies. Hence, a structured and efficient approach is essential. We overview work that has demonstrated the potential for using software tools in literature reviews. We highlight the untapped opportunities in using an end-to-end tool-supported literature review methodology. Qualitative data-analysis tools such as NVivo are immensely useful as a means to analyze, synthesize, and write up literature reviews. In this paper, we describe how to organize and prepare papers for analysis and provide detailed guidelines for actually coding and analyzing papers, including detailed illustrative strategies to effectively write up and present the results. We present a detailed case study as an illustrative example of the proposed approach put into practice. We discuss the means, value, and also pitfalls of applying tool-supported literature review approaches. We contribute to the literature by proposing a four-phased tool-supported methodology that serves as best practice in conducting literature reviews in IS. By viewing the literature review process as a qualitative study and treating the literature as the “data set”, we address the complex puzzle of how best to extract relevant literature and justify its scope, relevance, and quality. We provide systematic guidelines for novice IS researchers seeking to conduct a robust literature review.

%X The “standing on the shoulders of giants” metaphor is often used to acknowledge the work of others when undertaking research and, in particular, stresses the importance of literature reviews in scientific inquiry. Though the significance of literature reviews has never been in doubt, researchers, especially novice researchers, still struggle with developing effective strategies for reviewing literature. An important reason for this difficulty is the rapidly increasing number of potentially relevant publications—not all of which necessarily add value to a literature review. As such, avoiding standing on the shoulders of dwarfs literature search emerges as a major issue in crafting an effective literature review. In this paper, we discuss challenges of literature searches in the increasingly dynamic context of information systems (IS) research and make recommendations for how to deal with them. We present practical guidelines and a checklist to help researchers with planning and organizing their literature searches.

%X The accumulation of scientific knowledge is an important objective of information systems (IS) research. Although different review approaches exist in the continuum between narrative reviews and meta-analyses, most reviews in IS are narrative or descriptive—with all related drawbacks concerning objectivity and reliability—because available under¬lying sources in IS do typically not fulfil the requirements of formal approaches such as meta-analyses. To discuss how cumulative IS research can be effectively advanced using a more formalized approach fitting the current situation in IS research, in this paper, we point out the potential of stylized facts (SFs). SFs are interesting, sometimes counterintuitive patterns in empirical data that focus on the most relevant aspects of observable phenomena by abstracting from details (stylization). SFs originate from the field of economics and have been successfully used in different fields of research for years. In this paper, we discuss their potential and challenges for literature reviews in IS. We supplement our argumentation with an application example reporting our experience with SFs. Because SFs show considerable potential for cumulative research, they seem to be a promising instrument for literature reviews and especially for theory development in IS.

%X Research disciplines and subdisciplines are steeped in epistemological beliefs and theoretical assumptions that guide and constrain research. These beliefs and assumptions both enable scientific inquiry and limit scientific progress. Theory and review papers tend to be a means for reproducing ideological assumptions. However, review papers can also challenge ideological assumptions by critically assessing taken-for-granted assumptions. Critical review methods are underdeveloped in the management disciplines. The information systems (IS) discipline must do more to improve the critical examination of its scientific discourse. In this paper, we present a method with guiding principles and steps for systematically conducting critical reviews of IS literature based on Habermasian strains of critical discourse analysis. We provide an empirical example of the method. The empirical example offers a critical review of behavioral information security research with a focus on employees’ security behaviors.

%X The literature review is an established research genre in many academic disciplines, including the IS discipline. Although many scholars agree that systematic literature reviews should be rigorous, few instructional texts for compiling a solid literature review, at least with regard to the IS discipline, exist. In response to this shortage, in this tutorial, I provide practical guidance for both students and researchers in the IS community who want to methodologically conduct qualitative literature reviews. The tutorial differs from other instructional texts in two regards. First,  in contrast to most textbooks, I cover not only searching and synthesizing the literature but also the challenging tasks of framing the literature review, interpreting research findings, and proposing research paths. Second, I draw on other texts that provide guidelines for writing literature reviews in the IS discipline but use many examples of published literature reviews. I use an integrated example of a literature review, which guides the reader through the overall process of compiling a literature review.

%X With this paper, we hope to foster debate about the place of open access (OA) in scholarly publishing. After providing a background to OA’s development and current state, we examine some of the accusations leveled against it: that OA publishers are predatory, that OA is too expensive, and that self-depositing papers in OA repositories will bring about the end of scholarly publishing. After contextualizing each accusation, we show that they arise from problems with not only access, open or otherwise, but also the scholarly publishing system more broadly. Accordingly, we instead propose the discussions we believe the scholarly community should be having about scholarly publishing to take advantage of social and technological innovations and move it into the 21st century.

%X In this paper, we respond to five rebuttals to Kingsley and Kennan (2015). Four researchers in the information systems field and a university library director of research infrastructure provided these rebuttals. Almost without exception, the rebuttals from the information systems researchers take an analytical approach to the question of scholarly communication in their field. However, in undertaking their individual analyses of scholarly publishing or communication, they do not directly address the issues raised in our original debate piece. The rebuttal from the university library administrator (Groenewegen, 2015) alone directly addresses the discussion points raised in the original debate. As researchers in the field of scholarly communications, while this was not how we originally envisioned the debate, the rebuttals as a body of work have opened up some interesting themes, which we explore in addition to responding to the individual rebuttals.

%X Consumers are increasingly using Internet portals when searching for relevant health information. Despite the broad range of health information portals (HIPs) available, usage problems with such portals are still widely recognized and reported. In this study, we analyzed usage data from an operational health information portal and identified ways in which these problems can be addressed. While previous usage data and log analysis research has focused more on user behaviors, query structures, and human-computer interaction issues, this study covers more comprehensive issues such as content. We describe a taxonomy of usage issues derived from a literature analysis. We describe how we validated and refined the taxonomy based on analyzing the usage data from an operational health portal. Findings from the usage data indicate that a range of content issues exist that lead to unsuccessful searches. The analysis also highlights that users’ ineffective information seeking strategies are not well supported by the system’s design. We use this taxonomy to propose a usage-driven, consumer-centered approach for dynamic improvements of HIPs.  We also discuss the study’s limitations and directions for future research.

%X Desktop management consists of the systematic activities performed by IS professionals to manage distributed computing resources throughout an organization.  However, it does not appear that desktop management is being practiced extensively by organizations at this time.  This paper,  a comprehensive tutorial whose purpose is to raise awareness concerning the importance and potential of desktop management, examines the following issues:    (1) What is the significance of desktop management?   (2) What management practices constitute desktop management?   (3) What are the benefits associated with implementing desktop        management practices? (4) Why is desktop management not implemented?   (5) What is the future of desktop management?   The significance of desktop management is explored relative to total cost of ownership and the actions by the computer industry to support desktop management.  Desktop management practice is described from two perspectives: (1) the software tools that enable and facilitate desktop management, and (2) the managerial activities associated with the discipline of desktop management.  The benefits of desktop management covered in this paper include reduced cost of ownership, improved user productivity, and enhanced competitive advantage. However, desktop management is not widely practiced at this time, and the reasons for this state of affairs are examined briefly. Sales projections for desktop management software and interest in the topic on the Internet provide evidence that desktop management will be an important issue in the future.  Issues that will impact that future include alternate ways of reducing total cost of ownership, increased use of mobile devices, and the emergence of enterprise system management tools.

%X A significant amount of information technology (IT) research centers on the attainment of competitive advantage through the use of IT.  In many cases, the use of patents to protect that IT does not receive much attention. Often  studies conclude that patent protection cannot help IT to achieve such an advantage.  Our research finds that many IT researchers based these conclusions predominately on two studies that are no longer relevant.  This paper reviews some of that IT research and then links that research to these two dated studies.  A number of reasons why researchers may continue to use the research for support of their conclusions are put forth, including lack of knowledge, research as a lagging indicator, pressure to complete research   The paper offers recommendations for improving the research efforts such as using law as a reference discipline, considering the law in the reviewing process, and including legal considerations in doctoral training. We conclude with lessons learned.

%X This paper presents an in-depth longitudinal case analysis of the non-implementation of an information technology (IT) strategy within a UK hospital. The analysis covered the period from 1991 to the present day. The contents of the IT strategy are described and compared to the proposed systems and schedule is contrasted with the actual IT systems delivered. Because the case deals with the national health arrangements within the UK, we begin with a brief description of information management (IM) within the National Health Service (NHS) to provide background for readers outside the UK. This discussion is extended to consider the specific context of IS development. It notes the experience of a single patient being transported through medical procedures to illustrate the relevant systems which are enabled. The case documents the ambitions and achievements of the managers involved and concludes with the observation that their decisions did actually generate added-value to the IS implementation process even though, in the circumstances, no recognized strategy emerged.

The workshop demonstrated the effectiveness of Visible Analyst Workbench (VAW) as a systems modeling tool that generates comprehensive Process Models with multi-level Data Flow Diagrams, Data Models with Entity Relationship Diagrams, Structure Charts for automatic code generation, and Functional Decomposition Diagrams as system planning tools.  A simulated teaching case with four structured exercises integrated the conceptual foundations of the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) with the practical difficulties of building complex business information systems models.  The workshop also discussed how simulated teaching cases and CASE software could be used as pedagogical tools for foundational courses in systems analysis and design.

%X This paper presents the results of research studies that use innovative educational materials to teach business and engineering courses.  The innovation was part of a National Science Foundation grant to develop multimedia case studies that include photos, videos, and textual materials that bring real-world issues to the classroom.  When these case studies were used in the classrooms, the students assumed roles of the managers and technical personnel discussed in the case and defended the position assigned to them.  During this process, students are expected to integrate business skills with technical knowledge, enhance their decision-making skills, use principles of risk and cost management to solve problems, and enhance teamwork.  Evaluation of the use of these materials in undergraduate classrooms shows that the students perceive enhanced opportunities for active learning and improvement of their higher-level cognitive skills. In addition, these case studies were shown to stimulate interest in non-engineering, female, and minority students about  engineering and technical topics.  The article is based on a workshop at the Americas Conference on Information Systems 2001 in Boston.

%X The integration of Enterprise Systems into the curriculum of Business, Engineering, and Information Technology Faculties and Schools is a major challenge for many universities. Many interesting attributes are associated with this challenge: students generally have a strong interest to learn the subject and are often biased towards product-focused materials and skills; Enterprise Systems are comprehensive and particularly complex; and practical knowledge about Enterprise Systems is often lagging. This paper provides some structure to the Enterprise Systems education issue and will help academics distinguish among different approaches for the integration of these software packages into their curriculum. Various examples will assist beginners as well as experienced academics in evaluating their efforts. The ideas in this paper were presented in a special pre-conference workshop at the 2001 annual meeting of the Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS) in Boston.

%X Speech technologies are coming of age. They are applied in an increasing number of mobile, call-center, home and office settings. They challenge the established Graphical User Interface metaphor and promise to fundamentally alter the way humans conceptualize and interact with computers. This change leads to new requirements for the development of information systems. It also provides new research issues and opportunities for the academic community. In this article, the main elements of speech technologies will be presented and their applications will be discussed.  The article does not focus on technical aspects of speech technologies but is concerned with the business aspects of applying such technologies.

The question at hand is whether this upgrade is justified, and how long the new capabilities will last before another request for yet another upgrade.    In addition to addressing issues about the importance of infrastructure and the justification of IT investments, this case provides an example that illustrates concepts related to system life cycles, the alignment between business strategy and IT strategy, and the uncertainties related to whether IT investments will be successful.

%X The modern enterprise depends upon timely and effective flows of knowledge through its organizations for success. But knowledge is not evenly distributed through the enterprise, and a dearth of information systems is available to enable such timely and effective flows. Further, the few theoretical knowledge-flow models available have not yet been developed to a point where they can effectively inform the design of information systems and business processes to support knowledge flow in the enterprise.  A survey of current practice shows that such system and process design is accomplished principally by trial and error, one of the least effective approaches known. The research described in this article builds upon and extends current theory about knowledge flow. It focuses in particular on investigating flow dynamics to inform the design of information systems and business processes to enhance the flow of knowledge through the enterprise. Leveraging the good understanding of flows in other domains, we strive to extend theory that can lead to "devices" of considerable utility in the enterprise knowledge domain. The result is a four-dimensional, dynamic model that can be used to classify and visualize a diversity of knowledge-flow patterns through the enterprise. These patterns can, in turn, be analyzed to inform the design of useful information systems and business processes. The implications of this dynamic model are explored and a number of hypotheses are generated to motivate and guide future research into the phenomenology of knowledge flow.

The tutorial also provides a basic understanding of how to plan, evaluate and successfully refine a data mining project, particularly in terms of model building and model evaluation. Methodological considerations are discussed and illustrated. After explaining the nature of data mining and its importance in business, the tutorial describes the underlying machine learning and statistical techniques involved.  It describes the CRISP-DM standard now being used in industry as the standard for a technology-neutral data mining process model. The paper concludes with a major illustration of the data mining process methodology and the unsolved problems that offer opportunities for research.   The approach is both practical and conceptually sound in order to be useful to both academics and practitioners.

%X Although virtual reality (VR) technology has been available since the 1970's, it is becoming increasingly sophisticated and cost effective.  Architecture, education, medicine, electronic commerce, collaboration, and data visualization are some of areas where VR is beginning to be applied. Much of the reported research on VR is technological rather than social, leaving only a limited understanding of its behavioral and organizational impacts and its potential for novel situations. Immersion, interactivity, and presence are intriguing concepts that emerged as important to VR research, but are yet ill-defined. In this paper we argue that the information system research community offers a unique and valuable perspective on VR research, and that this capability represents a logical extension of the work in several IS research domains. Multi-methodological approaches using both positivist and emergent perspectives are needed. A research framework that can be used to begin this work is described.

In this article, based on a panel discussion at the 2001 International Conference on Information Systems, three arguments are explored in connection with IS research relevance. The first argument, called "subtle accomplishment", suggests that IS research is relevant, but in a subtle way. The second argument, called "unfulfilled promise", maintains that the promise of conducting relevant research is still unfulfilled. The third argument, called "serial hypocrisy", argues that, while "relevance to practice" is frequently proclaimed as a virtue in public, in reality practical relevance does not matter in IS research.

%X This article combines two real world cases involving expensive, but highly unsuccessful IT initiatives in small companies. One initiative used commercial software package; the other used custom-built software. Both cases illustrate common mishaps that occur in smaller companies whose employees and management have not paid much attention to the challenges of building systems in organizations. Both cases leave the reader with questions about what should be done next. Students using these cases benefit in the following ways: Each of these brief cases provides enough details to see how project and life cycle principles really do matter, and how lack of attention to these principles frequently leads to disaster. Students comparing the two cases can identify for themselves a set of project principles that might have led to better outcomes. Each case provides a possibility of asking students to deal with a series of questions that any business professional must deal with in defining an IT initiative and deciding whether it has a high probability of success. These questions include: What problem does the IT initiative address? What work system has this problem? Exactly what information will the information system create or use? What is the relationship between the information system and the work system it supports? How would success be measured? Each case also provides an opportunity to look at prior student recommendations and question whether they are justified by the facts or whether other recommendations might be better.

%X Educators are increasingly incorporating the development of research case studies as a course assignment in graduate and executive degree courses. Each student (or student group) develops a research case study that provides theory-based explanation and discussion of how a real organization managed a business issue related to the course. In the process, the student gains a deeper understanding of business theories and their applications as well as current business issues and their interactions with internal and external organizational forces. While a significant amount of literature is written on developing case studies for full-time academic researchers, little is done to provide guidelines to student researchers, who face unique issues and constraints in this research-based learning process. This paper introduces case study research method and offers a roadmap to student researchers.

This paper examines the association of board characteristics with IT investment decisions and the role of the CIO. Our research confirms that CEOs and boards of companies to date have limited IT experience. We find that younger boards, and those with more IT-experienced external board members are associated with larger IT investments and the presence and role of a CIO.

Given the large income disparities and low telephone penetration. rates in most Latin American countries, only about 4% of the region's population can access the Internet. The International Telecommunication Union reports that teledensity (the number of telephone land-lines per 100 people) in Latin America is currently at about 10.8%. Prior research identified specific factors that hinder growth of teledensity in developing countries and specific strategies used to overcome such limitations. This study investigates Latin American telecommunication stakeholders' perspective of how these strategies can be used to address teledensity growth in the region. Survey participants (Latin America's telecommunications stakeholders) analyzed the strategies critically and modified, enhanced, or added new insights. Using appropriate statistical procedures we examined the telecommunications stakeholders' perceptions to find potential solutions the low teledensity problem. Qualitative comments to support the stakeholders' responses are reported, together with future research implications.

%X A major challenge for healthcare is how to provide improved services to an increasing number of people using limited financial and human resources. Pervasive healthcare is considered a solution to many existing problems and a possible future of the current healthcare services. In simple terms, pervasive healthcare can be defined as healthcare to anyone, anytime, and anywhere by removing locational, time and other restraints while increasing both its coverage and quality. The broad definition includes prevention, healthcare maintenance and checkups, short-term monitoring (or home healthcare monitoring), long-term monitoring (nursing home), personalized healthcare monitoring, incidence detection and management, and, emergency intervention, transportation and treatment. These requirements could be effectively supported by universal, efficient and reliable access to healthcare services, providers, and biomedical information that is available at any time. In this paper, several pervasive healthcare applications and related challenges are discussed. An integrated wireless architecture that is designed to use the capabilities of current and emerging wireless and mobile networks for location management, intelligent emergency system, patient monitoring, and mobile telemedicine applications is presented.

%X The growth of unsolicited commercial e-mail (UCE) imposes increasing costs on organizations and causes considerable aggravation on the part of e-mail recipients. A thriving anti-spam industry addresses some of the frustration. Regulation and various economic and technical means are in the works. All anti-spam measures aim at bringing down the flood of unwanted commercial e-mail.  This paper draws on scholarly work in marketing, resource ownership, and use.  Adapting the tragedy of the commons concept to e-mail, we identify a causal structure that drives the direct e-marketing industry. Computer simulations indicate that although filtering may be an effective method to curb UCE arriving at individual inboxes, it is likely to increase the aggregate volume, thereby boosting overall costs.  We also examine other response mechanisms, including self-regulation, government regulation, and market mechanisms. We find that, of the various countermeasures, filtering appears to be the best currently available but that none are a satisfactory solution. The analysis advances understanding of the digital commons, the economics of UCE, and provides practical implications for the direct e-marketing industry.

%X Given the growing concern over information privacy abuse, potential lawsuits, and threats of increased government privacy legislation, an increasing number of firms are resorting to Chief Privacy Officers (CPOs) as a means to cope with information privacy. However, little is yet known about the job responsibilities and roles of this emerging corporate position. This study examines the critical managerial roles of CPOs. Drawing from in-depth interviews at three large firms and from  secondary sources of data, this study uses Mintzberg's framework for managerial work to develop a taxonomy of key managerial roles for the emerging position of Chief Privacy Officer. From our analysis, we conclude that Chief Privacy Officers function with role responsibilities in four main areas: informational (monitor, disseminator, spokesperson), interpersonal (figurehead, liaison), conflict management (disturbance handler, negotiator), and strategic management (entrepreneur). Our analysis also suggests that no single managerial role is most important. Rather, multiple roles are required of CPOs. To meet these multiple role requirements, effective CPOs must possess strong business, communications, and technical skills. Our results suggest that Chief Privacy Officers tend to operate at high levels of organizational hierarchies as evidenced by the importance of their externally related job roles of figurehead, liaison, and spokesperson.

%X Extant research in information systems relies heavily on career anchor theory (CAS) as a lens to examine occupational choices and outcomes in information technology. Yet, the empirical results are inconclusive, and the power of the theory in predicting IT occupations is rather weak. With the growing demand for IT professionals, we need to examine other factors that can predict the IT occupational outcomes. In this paper, we draw on social cognitive career theory (SCCT) and examine self-efficacy as a complementary factor to career anchors in predicting whether seekers end up with technical, business, or managerial occupations in IT. Specifically, we propose and test a model that combines variables from both CAS and SCCT theories. We use multiple discriminant analysis to measure the extent to which variables from both theories discriminate the IT occupations. The results show that our model predicts occupations with an accuracy rate of 82.2 percent (compared to 75.2 percent for the original CAS model). Our results also show that individuals who hold a professional role that matches their profile are more satisfied than those who do not. Lastly, we discovered that, from individuals who hold a position that does not match their profile, business-IT professionals are most satisfied.

%X Smartphones and tablets are ubiquitous for personal use and are increasingly employed for business purposes. When paired with business intelligence to create mobile BI, workers are able to access information wherever they are, at any time, and through a variety of devices. This use has the potential to increase employee productivity, enhance customer service and satisfaction, improve decision making, provide a competitive advantage, and improve the bottom line. Mobility can make BI pervasive throughout an organization, but it is most likely to be used by executives, mid-level and operational managers, sales representatives, and field and internal technicians. To be successful with mobile BI, we must address various issues and challenges such as creating a roadmap, getting started right, meeting user expectations, creating an appropriate technology infrastructure, designing for screen size, and providing for security. Case studies of U.S.Xpress, a leading trucking company, and GUESS, a leading retailer of clothing and accessories, provide many real-world examples of the concepts, options, and best practices associated with mobile BI. Following mainframe, client/server, and Web-based approaches, mobile BI is the fourth generation of how information is delivered.

%X Sustainability is one of the key issues that organizations confront today, and ecologically responsible ("green") information systems (IS) initiatives are manifestations of sustainable business practices. Engaging in green IS initiatives can be challenging due to poor understanding of their holistic process. In this research, we develop a multi-theoretical framework to provide a holistic understanding of the process of implementing and adopting green IS initiatives. The framework examines how these initiatives’ structures, organizational attributes, and environment may influence this process. The framework also provides an agenda for how future studies of green IS can use the constructs proposed and develop them, undertake case studies to expand our propositions, and conduct surveys to verify propositions. In addition, practitioners can use our framework to better understand the differences between various types of green IS initiatives, identify which organizational and environmental factors to adopt, and gain a holistic view of the entire process.

%X Service innovations, enabled by the confluence of big data, mobile solutions, cloud, social, and cognitive computing, and the Internet of Things, have gained a lot of attention among many enterprises in the past few years because they represent promising ways for companies to effectively and rapidly deliver new services. But one of today's most pervasive and bedeviling challenges is how to start this journey and stay on course. In this paper, we review some of the important developments in this area and reports the views voiced by five industry leaders from IBM, Cisco, HP, and ISSIP at a panel session at the 24th Annual Compete through Service Symposium in 2013. Panelists provided an extensive list of recommendations to academicians and professionals. The biggest conclusion is that all of the information and communications technology (ICT)-enabled service innovations need to be human-centered and focused on co-creating value.

%X One can use trust networks to find trustworthy information, people, products, and services on public networks. Hence, they have the potential to combine the advantages of search, recommendation systems, and social networks. But proper design and correct incentives are critical to the success of such networks. In this paper, I propose a trust network architecture that emphasizes simplicity and robustness. I propose a trust network with constrained trust relationships and design a decentralized search and recommendation process. I create both informational and monetary incentives to encourage joining the network, to investigate and discover other trustworthy agents, and to make commitments to them by trusting them, by insuring them, or even by directly investing in them. I show that making the correct judgments about trustworthiness of others and reporting it truthfully are the optimum strategies since they reward the agents both with information by providing access to more of the network and with monetary payments by paying them for their services as information intermediaries. The extensive income potential from the trust connections creates strong incentives to join the network, to create reliable trust connections, and to report them truthfully.

%X In this paper, we explore the complex process of how ideas evolve in organizations that are engaged in developing and using information technology (IT)-based systems. We put forward a framework emphasizing the interconnection between creativity and institutionalization. We argue that ideas are embedded in existing institutionalized technologies in organizations and that emerging technologies introduce neoteric ideas to them. Furthermore, we argue that, when attempting to introduce technology-based ideas, human actors will focus their attention on ideas embedded in existing institutionalized technologies while informally evaluating and making sense of these ideas. Moreover, we suggest that conflicts between competing frames of reference during this evaluation may result in the rejection, adoption, or multiplication of new technology ideas. Drawing on information systems (IS)-based theories of creativity, Scandinavian institutionalism, and empirical data from two Danish organizations, we investigate the interplay between creativity, technology, and human sensemaking in the process of translating and transforming technology ideas into full-fledged technological innovations.

%X Virtual health communities are a major channel through which health consumers share health-related knowledge and/or exchange social support with their peers. These virtual environments can be a form of, or a potential component of, integrated Patient-centered e-Health (PCEH) applications, which represent emerging healthcare information systems that emphasize the role of patients and revolve around providing patient-focus, patient-activity, and patient-empowerment services. Because of the collaborative nature of virtual health communities, user participation is a critical factor for community growth and prosperity. In this study, we examine user participation at the individual and group (thread) levels. At the individual level, we investigate the impact of reciprocity and homophily (similarity of user characteristics such as age, gender, and tenure) on user participation within virtual health communities. At the thread level, we study the role of highly active users (power users) as thread initiators as well as the role of thread initiators’ participation on the overall thread vibrancy. To do so, we analyzed 2,176 threads initiated by 130 users and 1,947 messages exchanged between these users and their peers. Our results support short-term reciprocity, but refute the positive relationship associated with long-term reciprocity. Among homophily hypotheses, our results support gender homophily, but not age or tenure homophily. At the thread level our findings suggest that a discussion thread is vibrant if the thread initiator is a power user or participates actively within the thread. These findings have important implications for future research and practice in PCEH applications.

%X People are increasingly looking for health-related information and support to empower their self-management and decision making. Online health communities have not only become an important alternative source of patient-centered information but also appear to serve an emotional support role in connecting patients who have similar medical conditions. Trust is critical to sustain their continuous use and enhance their involvement. This is because each community member is typically identified only by a pseudonym, important personal information is often revealed, the quality of information provided by others varies, and the consequences of acting on incorrect advice can be severe. Using semi-structured interviews and data from postings, this study qualitatively explores the trust development between users of forum-based online health communities. Based on data from a wide range of medical conditions, we formulated a three-process framework for establishing trust that conceptualizes how users build trust through the text-based medium and how they progress from one process to another. We contribute to theory by extending existing variance theories in trust to a hybrid process theory which explains the dynamic progression from one state to another. It suggests several design foci that can enhance user experience of these forums.

%X The phenomenon of social support―aid and assistance exchanged through social relationships and interpersonal transactions―has been studied extensively for decades. In the context of healthcare virtual support communities, researchers have focused on exploring community members’ support behavior and its effects on individuals’ health outcomes. This emphasis, however, has led to the neglect of another type of social interaction that also promotes individual health―companionship activities. We argue that in order to gain a deeper insight into the online support phenomenon, the consideration of companionship activities, in addition to social support exchange, is necessary. To bridge this gap in the literature, this article attempts to contrast community members’ support behavior and companionship activities in two large healthcare virtual support communities―one for patients with breast cancer and the other for patients with prostate cancer. Based on the identification of the two types of social activities from the two cancer support communities, the relationship between individuals’ participation in these activities, and gender differences in their activity engagement are also hypothesized and tested. Our goal is to advance the understanding of online socio-behavioral dynamics of virtual support communities. We also wish to provide insights into the design of such communities and the delivery of patient-focused healthcare interventions.

%X Information Systems researchers are often interested in comparing outcomes across different groups of interest, as in the case of experimental and quasi-experimental studies. These designs have traditionally been modeled, as we show through a review of our literature, by using analysis of variance techniques on observed scores, typically the sum or average of all items measuring the dependent variable of interest. These designs, however, can be analyzed with structural equation modeling and latent variables (SEM-LV) techniques, which can better accommodate measurement error and more complex models than would otherwise be possible using the traditional techniques. This research introduces the foundations of the SEM-LV approach for these research designs and highlights these advantages, and provides several examples that underscore the flexibility of the latent variable techniques discussed here. It also compares the two main alternatives for implementing this approach and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each.

%X Diffusion of Innovations and the Theory of Planned Behavior provide the foundation on which a preponderance of information systems (IS) theory and research is built. IS scholars often assume that the basic factors proffered by these theories are significant determinants of innovation adoption. However, there has yet to be a meta-analytic examination of research in the IS field to validate this assumption. Herein, we use Tornatzky and Klein’s seminal 1982 meta-analysis of innovation characteristics as the starting point for our meta-analytic examination of Diffusion of Innovations and Theory of Planned Behavior models in IS research. In order to focus our investigation on a common criterion variable, adoption propensity, we use antecedents from both models to develop a model of innovation adoption-behavior (IAB). After describing the relationships encompassed by the IAB model, we step through a bare-bones meta-analysis. Considering the data reported in fifty-eight empirical articles, we calculate the estimated true correlations with the criterion variable to be .53 for attitude toward behavior, .33 for subjective norm, .41 for perceived behavioral control, .42 for relative advantage, .43 for compatibility, -.28 for complexity, .32 for trialability, and .38 for observability. With the exception of complexity, all correlations generalize across studies.

%X Research and practice in the information systems (IS) field have been evolving over time, nourishing and promoting the development of applications that transform the relationships of individuals, corporations, and governments. Building on this evolution, we push forward a vision of the potential influence of the IS field into one of the most important problems of our times, an increasingly unsustainable world, which is traditionally considered the product of imperfect markets or market externalities. We describe our work in Full Information Product Pricing (FIPP) and our vision of a FIPP global socio-technical system, I-Choose, as a way to connect consumer choice and values with environmental, social, and economic effects of production and distribution practices. FIPP and I-Choose represent a vision about how information systems research can contribute to interdisciplinary research in supply chains, governance, and market economies to provide consumers with information packages that help them better understand how, where, and by whom the products they buy are produced. We believe that such a system will have important implications for international trade and agreements, for public policy, and for making a more sustainable world.

%X The publication record is a key component of a successful academic career in IS. Despite its importance, its definition―especially for junior researchers―remains unclear. Is it better to have one A-publication or three B-publications? Does being the third author on an A-publication carry more weight than being the first author on a B-publication? Is it better to publish with as few co-authors as possible to demonstrate ability for independent work or is publishing with others a sign of good teamwork and academic excellence? Faced with these uncertainties, young researchers increasingly question the choices they make regarding their publication strategy. If unaddressed, these issues are bound to interfere with the quality of the IS research and scholars’ job satisfaction. This article raises these concerns associated with a publication strategy for junior researchers and reports the views voiced by five academics at a panel session at the European Conference on Information Systems 2012. In particular, the following topics are discussed: quantity vs. quality, value of the first authorship, the “optimal” number of authors, and the issues of co-authorship with an academic supervisor.

This article builds on recent discussion on this topic within the IS community and is intended to move the conversation regarding the curriculum revision forward. Through three program exemplars and integrative discussion, the article identifies and addresses key questions related to the curriculum revision and provides guidance for any department that is currently in the process of modifying its degree program.

%X Mobile phones’ exponential growth is fuelling the emergence of mobile health (mHealth), thus contributing to healthcare services’ innovative transformation in developing countries. mHealth’s ubiquitous personalised capabilities obviate the access barriers and dismal performance of conventional systems, therefore gaining popularity among patients. Researchers have focused on service quality―a vital element of service adoption―and sustainability. For mHealth to become a robust alternative, how patients perceive mHealth vis-à-vis conventional services must be understood. Comparative analysis studies between mHealth and conventional systems are scarce yet would contribute to theory and strengthen the antecedent phases to service quality, that is, design and operation. mHealth is a viable alternative for fulfiling the unmet goal of quality of life for all. Prompted by these insights, this study is the first attempt to discover the differentiating characteristics of mHealth. Patients’ perceptions were analyzed by multiple discriminant analysis, a classification technique. The findings show that, in distinguishing between healthcare services, mHealth is a favourable alternative: service differentiation occurs along the dimensions of ubiquity, information-quality, and value. The findings’ implications for theory and practice and future research guidelines are also discussed.

Implementing a mixed research method, we found that employees had a positive perception of SRM toward all CSFs but one―team member empowerment (TME). Both medical professionals and staff had a negative perception of how TME was implemented at the institution.

%X Knowledge sourcing through knowledge repositories, people, and documents in organizational settings are investigated in this paper. This competition among the knowledge sources is modeled via the perceived usefulness and ease of use of a Knowledge Management System (KMS) and extends the work of Gray and Durcikova (2005-2006) by adopting the concept of competition among knowledge sources suggested by Zimmer et al (2007-2008). Results suggest that when a KMS is perceived to be useful, users tend to reduce the usage of printed documents as a source of knowledge. However, when a KMS is perceived to be useful and easy to use, knowledge sourcing from other individuals is not influenced. This suggests that while good quality KMS may be slowly replacing printed documents, they complement sourcing knowledge from colleagues rather than reducing it. Implications for future research and practice are offered.

%X Many healthcare reforms are to digitalize and integrate healthcare information systems. However, the disparity of business benefits in having an integrated healthcare information system (IHIS) varies with organizational fit factors. Critical success factors (CSFs) exist for hospitals to implement an IHIS successfully. This study investigated the relationship between the organizational fit and the system success. In addition, we examined the moderating effect of five CSFs -- information systems adjustment, business process adjustment, organizational resistance, top management support, and the capability of key team members – in an IHIS implementation. Fifty-three hospitals that have successfully undertaken IHIS projects participated in this study. We used regression analysis to assess the relationships. The findings of this study provide a roadmap for hospitals to capitalize on the organizational fit and the five critical success factors in order to implement successful IHIS projects.

%X This debate section article examines the notion of value or worth of IS research. It suggests that how others value the product of Information Systems (IS) research may be the underlying problem triggering various forms of anxiety discourses that are frequently recurring. The value of IS research is examined from the perspectives of ends-means, basic and applied research, and the significance of IS problems. The article also proposes ways of maintaining the value of IS research by emphasizing originality, being "active" and not "passive", and making evident what is not. The article argues that the value of IS research is found not in duplicating research already undertaken in management, computer science, psychology, economics or its other reference disciplines, but in asking questions that other disciplines are not asking or in addressing problems that others are incapable of addressing.

%X Building on a social constructivist approach, this commentary examines the value of Information Systems (IS) research and its bearing on the future of the discipline in three steps as follows. First, it is argued that the product of IS scholars can serve as a proxy for IS research and that the subject matter of IS research should be examined through the people-information-technology framework. Second, it is argued that value is inherently a situated social construction and that ultimately the value of IS research is determined by its particular stakeholders. Third, it is argued that the stakeholders’ appreciation and support can be fostered through grassroots collective action that aims to build a strong brand equity for IS research. In spite of the challenges ahead that stem from the current institutional position of the IS discipline and the prevailing work practices in the academia, the potential of IS scholarship can be realized if the members of the IS community will step forward and reframe the rules of the game.

%X This article is intended to address three of the issues raised by Hassan (2014) in his essay: “Value of Information Systems (IS) Research: Is there a Crisis?”.  The three issues addressed here pertain to: (1) the desirability and nature of an IS core; (2) the relative social value in the study of IS whether narrowly or broadly defined; and (3) indicators of better research.  Regarding the core, an argument for a narrow definition of the core is proposed with the view of providing a target for retention of central issues in IS rather than as a defining characteristic of what is necessary for inclusion in the IS portfolio.  The meaning of social value will naturally and beneficially vary among the large number of IS scholars.  It is of importance to recognize and stimulate, without mandating, efforts to bridge traditional IS concerns and broader social issues.  The various criteria for evaluating value in IS, or any other research domain, are challenged with counter examples.  Finally, suggestions for moving forward are presented.

%X I argue that the Information Systems (IS) field is at a crossroads, not a crisis.  Across a variety of metrics, the field has progressed fabulously.  The quality of our journals and the research they embody is on par with other business disciplines.  However, our course of drawing from reference disciplines, creating different instantiations of models, having everyone engage in theory and empirics, and limiting our actionable implications – might be creating an impediment for us.  We need to expend more energy in dealing with bigger questions that characterize contemporary digital environments.  This will require some thoughtful discussion and introspection – so that we can fight against the institutional forces that limit our value proposition.

%X The micro-political and pragmatic ideas introduced by Nik Hassan can change our view about the nature of the field’s crisis from problems with the production of relevant knowledge through theory and methodology, towards our inattention to the power-knowledge politics of our field.  Turning to this later possibility allows and requires us to be more foolish and playful about thinking through the nature of and responses to our research crisis, and provides the possibilities for alternative research practices to manoeuvre within and through varying micro-political influences.  A few suggestions are offered using this strategy.

%X We support the call by Nik Hassan for a more nuanced account of the value of Information Systems (IS) research situated in “the intellectual ideals of the academic field, its goals and mission, intellectual structures activities and relationship with its environment” (paper in this issue). In this paper we examine the process by which this notion of ‘knowledge value’ is increasingly being marginalised in the IS discipline by more pragmatic measures of the value of research as a ‘product’ in certain academic ‘markets’. We argue that the increasing centrality that maximising this ‘product value’ assumes in the lives of IS academics helps make sense of the IS ‘discourses of anxiety’ that Nik Hassan documents. Further, the distortion of research practices that widely accepted ideologies of measurement and efficiency bring about, threatens to diminish the holistic knowledge value of research that Nik Hassan articulates. In short, we argue that we are at risk of putting the score ahead of the game. We make our case by showing that the mechanisms by which this value displacement is transpiring in IS, exhibit strong parallels to those that have been shown to underpin disastrous episodes of large-scale efficiency-motivated social reengineering more generally.

This response argues for a focus on internal efforts to put our house in order ahead of reputational maneuverings, and proposes a closer examination of our intellectual structures.

%X IT Service Management (ITSM) is transforming the management of the IT function on a global scale with major changes in work practices. The intent of this study is to empirically explore how IT service management is adopted in today’s global economy. The article examines the adoption of ITSM processes as defined in the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL®). The adoption of operational processes is compared to that of tactical/strategic level processes and the contribution of country, size, and industry sector to variation in adoption of ITIL processes is assessed. Institutional theory is used as a foundation for the study. The analysis is based on 623 responses to three surveys conducted in the UK, USA, DACH (German-speaking countries) and Australia.
%X The study found organisations adopting ITIL implemented more operational level processes than the tactical/strategic level processes. DACH countries exhibit higher ITIL process adoption than the UK, USA, and Australia. Adoption varied on industry sector, and, in part, on organisation size. Based on a discussion of theory and practice, the article derives insights for academics and industry when introducing ITSM in the IT function.

%X While unfortunate physical events result in a negative market reaction, cyber events rarely do. It is our contention that a security attack is a complex intervention that ripples through the attacked company’s ecosystem. Over time, new information about the incident is revealed which might change the trajectory of the effect. This study aims to understand the impact of a security breach on the attacked company, its ecosystem (e.g., consumers, vendors, banks, and hackers), and surrounding society. By utilizing a stakeholder analysis as a methodological framework, we found that, while some stakeholders are losers, other are winners. Our analysis also implies that, depending on subsequent events, the effect of a security breach on the attacked firm varies over time, suggesting a “wait and see” attitude by the market.

%X Impact sourcing is the practice of training and hiring marginalized individuals (people who normally would have few opportunities for good employment) to provide information technology (IT), business process, or other digitally-enabled services. Perhaps no other population is more marginalized than prisoners. Worldwide there are over six million prisoners, of which over two million areU.S.prisoners. In theU.S., 95 percent of inmates will one day be released. Prison employment programs are interventions aimed at preparing inmates to reenter society. We studied a special type of prison employment program: the hiring and training of prisoners to perform business services using a computer. The impact of prison sourcing needs to be understood in two distinct time periods: while in prison and after prison. Based on a case study at a U.S. Federal Correctional Institution employing 140 inmates in prison sourcing, we found evidence that prison sourcing for business services positively affects the inmates while in prison. The main benefits are good financial compensation, work habit development, productively occupying time, development of business skills, and the elevation of self-efficacy and status. We have almost no data about the impact on future prospects and explain why this gap happens.

%X The management of risk in business processes has been the subject of active research in the past few years. Potentially, many benefits can be obtained by integrating the two traditionally separated fields of risk management and business process management, including the ability to minimize risks in business processes by design and to mitigate such risks at run time. While there has been an increasing amount of research aimed at delivering such an integrated system, these research efforts vary in terms of scope, goals, and functionality. Through the systematic collection and evaluation of relevant literature, this article compares and classifies current approaches in the area of risk-aware business process management in order to expose and explain current research gaps. The process through which relevant literature was collected, filtered, and evaluated is also detailed. Finally, a research agenda is proposed.

%X Data mining is a useful analytic method and has been increasingly used by organizations to gain insights from large-scale data. Prior studies of data mining have focused on developing automatic data mining models that belong to first-order data mining. Recently, researchers have called for more study of the second-order data mining process. Second-order data mining process is an important step to convert data mining results into intelligent knowledge, i.e., actionable knowledge. Specifically, second-order data mining refers to the post-stage of data mining projects in which humans collectively make judgments on data mining models’ performance. Understanding the second-order data mining process is valuable in addressing how data mining can be used best by organizations in order to achieve competitive advantages. Drawing on the theory of habitual domains, this study developed a conceptual model for understanding the impact of human cognition characteristics on second-order data mining. Results from a field survey study showed significant correlations between habitual domain characteristics, such as educational level and prior experience with data mining, and human judgments on classifiers’ performance.

%X Shared services have gained significance as an organizational arrangement, in particular for support functions, to reduce costs, increase quality, and create new capabilities. The information systems (IS) function is amenable to sharing arrangements and information systems can enable sharing in other functional areas. However, despite being a promising area for IS research, literature on shared services in the IS discipline is scarce and scattered. There is still little consensus on what shared services is. Moreover, a thorough understanding of why shared services are adopted, who are involved, and how things are shared is lacking. In this article, we set out to progress IS research on shared services by establishing a common ground for future research and proposing a research agenda to shape the field based on an analysis of the IS literature. We present a holistic and inclusive definition, discuss the primacy of economic-strategic objectives so far, and introduce conceptual frameworks for stakeholders and the notion of sharing. We also provide an overview of the theories and research methods applied. We propose a research agenda that addresses fundamental issues related to objectives, stakeholders, and the notion of sharing to lay the foundation for taking IS research on shared services forward.

%X Political interest and voter turnout is in steady decline. In an attempt to renew interest for political matters, political parties and governments have attempted to create new digital meeting places, with the hope that social media can contribute to renew the public sphere and thereby increase political awareness in the population. Communicating in new media demands adaption to the culture of the new medium, and the networked nature of the Internet poses challenges to old ways of thinking as we can no longer talk about one public sphere but rather a networked public sphere consisting of a multitude of discussion spaces. In this article, we contribute to the understanding of the networked public sphere and online political communication through a case study of MyLaborParty.no, a social network run by a Norwegian political party. Our findings indicate that political parties can create a thriving part of the networked public sphere, as long as they invite opposing voices to the discussion, communicate using the genres which facilitate discussion and have users or moderators who help spread ideas between discussion spaces.

%X Although mentioned frequently in the organization, management, public administration, and technology literatures, workarounds are understudied and undertheorized. This article provides an integrated theory of workarounds that describes how and why workarounds are created. The theory covers most types of workarounds and most situations in which workarounds occur in operational systems. This theory is based on a broad but useful definition of workaround that clarifies the preconditions for the occurrence of a workaround. The literature review is organized around a diagram that combines the five “voices” in the literature of workarounds. That diagram is modeled after the diagram summarizing Orton and Weick’s [1990] loose coupling theory, which identified and combined five similar voices in the literature about loose coupling. Building on that basis, the theory of workarounds is a process theory driven by the interaction of key factors that determine whether possible workarounds are considered and how they are executed. This theory is useful for classifying workarounds and analyzing how they occur, for understanding compliance and noncompliance to methods and management mandates, for incorporating consideration of possible workarounds into systems analysis and design, and for studying how workarounds and other adaptations sometimes lead to larger planned changes in systems.

%X An assumption implied by much of the literature in information systems (IS) research is that people’s interpretations of technology influence the way in which technology gets adapted in organizations. Despite this acknowledgment, little insight is provided for how these interpretations can be elicited, and only a few studies suggest methods for doing so. In this article we address this opportunity by advancing cognitive mapping as a well-established method to systematically inquire into people’s interpretations of technology. We show how cognitive maps can serve as visual means of representation of these interpretations and discuss how the maps can be used to facilitate individual reflection and collective negotiation of technology adaptation. We illustrate the use of the cognitive mapping method with a case example of the introduction of an electronic patient record (EPR) system in a hospital setting. Based on our findings, we engage in a discussion of the value of cognitive mapping as a facilitating technique of individual reflection, as well as collective negotiation and construction in relation to technology adaptation. This implies a discussion of the epistemological, theoretical, and practical implications of its use.

%X For over 125 years, the Hong Kong Jockey Club (“the Club”) had been Hong Kong’s sole organizer of horseraces. Although it had made horserace betting a popular game in Hong Kong, its customers were aging. To change this, the Club launched a project to make the game more enjoyable for its customers of the technology-savvy generation. Based on market research and the latest technological developments, the project team set out to transform the customers’ journey from studying horses to placing a bet. It wanted to develop large multi-touch tables with an integrated smartcard payment system. But this meant major technical and organizational hurdles along the way. After two years the Club launched the world’s largest betting entertainment tables. This teaching case describes the Club’s project from defining the problem to evaluating its innovation, emphasizing the importance and difficulties of customer-oriented design.

%X Organizations use different approaches when they plan for information systems (IS). IS planning (ISP) approaches range on a continuum with two alternative approaches as the polar ends: comprehensive to incremental. For different IS-related decisions, organizations may simultaneously use different approaches. While the heterogeneity of ISP approaches has been generally acknowledged in IS research, the contingent factors that lead organizations to choose approaches that vary in comprehensiveness are understudied. Our study explores contingent factors that influence IS planning approaches in organizations. Using interview data from six small and medium-sized organizations, we identify categories of technology- and organization-related factors that affect ISP comprehensiveness and discuss related management and research implications.

%X The fast growing adoption of smartphones has accentuated the importance of privacy in the context of mobile computing. While most research has focused on general privacy concerns and their impact on intentions to disclose personal information, little is known about how perceptions of a privacy breach affect ongoing relationships between users and mobile providers. To address this gap, we develop a research framework grounded in psychological contract theory. We test this framework with a survey-based study of smartphone users who are presented with a scenario of a privacy breach. We find that perceptions of privacy breach negatively affect trust and commitment and lead to an increase in cynicism. In turn, trust, commitment, and cynicism are highly predictive of smartphone user intention to terminate the relationship with the mobile carrier. We also evaluate the effects of perceived availability of alternatives and contractual lock-in. The nomological framework developed in the current study provides the foundation for further investigation of perceived privacy breach across practically relevant contexts.

%X Theory-driven structural equation modeling (SEM) is an increasingly popular technique for analyzing quantitative data in Information Systems research.  Since 1994, 20% of all papers in top-tier journals use structural equation modeling [Urbach and Ahlemann, 2010].  Higher-order factor structures have been widely discussed from a number of theoretical perspectives [e.g., Bagozzi and Edwards, 1998; Hayduk, Ratner, Johnson and Bottorff, 1995; Law, Wong and Mobley, 1998].  Our intention is not to contradict these theoretical discussions but to postulate that empirical analysis can assist in the discovery of emergent higher-order structures where perhaps not initially proposed. As constructs have become both more numerous and specific, the existence of higher levels of multicollinearity, even when discriminant validity is evident, are becoming problematic for assessing the role of individual constructs.  Thus, there becomes a need for a higher-order structure to represent these relationships. In this paper, we present a six-step methodology for researchers who have structural models suffering from multicollinearity, positing that multicollinearity can obscure an underlying higher-order structure.  We present findings from an empirical study where multicollinearity had masked the presence of a higher-order structure.  We conclude with a proposed methodology for discovering higher-order factor models.

%X This article summarizes a panel held at the 15th Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems (PACIS) in Brisbane, Austrailia, in 2011. The panelists proposed a new research agenda for information systems success research. The DeLone and McLean IS Success Model has been one of the most influential models in Information Systems research. However, the nature of information systems continues to change. Information systems are increasingly implemented across layers of infrastructure and application architecture. The diffusion of information systems into many spheres of life means that information systems success needs to be considered in multiple contexts. Services play a much more prominent role in the economies of countries, making the “service” context of information systems increasingly important. Further, improved understandings of theory and measurement offer new opportunities for novel approaches and new research questions about information systems success.

%X We have entered the big data era. Organizations are capturing, storing, and analyzing data that has high volume, velocity, and variety and comes from a variety of new sources, including social media, machines, log files, video, text, image, RFID, and GPS. These sources have strained the capabilities of traditional relational database management systems and spawned a host of new technologies, approaches, and platforms. The potential value of big data analytics is great and is clearly established by a growing number of studies. The keys to success with big data analytics include a clear business need,  strong committed sponsorship, alignment between the business and IT strategies, a fact-based decision-making culture, a strong data infrastructure, the right analytical tools, and people skilled in the use of analytics. Because of the paradigm shift in the kinds of data being analyzed and how this data is used, big data can be considered to be a new, fourth generation of decision support data management. Though the business value from big data is great, especially for online companies like Google and Facebook, how it is being used is raising significant privacy concerns.

S’agit-il de décisions courantes sans influence particulière de la Direction Générale ou au contraire de décisions pouvant amener à un renouvellement profond de l’entreprise et de sa fonction SI ? Pour y répondre, nous avons administré un questionnaire s’adressant aux Directeurs des systèmes d’information des moyennes et grandes entreprises françaises, belges et suisses à partir d’une base de données des entreprises clientes d’Orange Business Services. L’analyse des résultats confirme majoritairement la perception ordinaire des décisions d’externalisation en ce sens qu’elles n’entraînent pas de transformation organisationnelle profonde. Cependant, pour d’autres entreprises les résultats soulignent également la pertinence d’une lecture transformationnelle de l’externalisation. En effet, certaines décisions d’externalisation ou leur répétition dans le temps engendrent un renouvellement profond de la fonction SI impactant ses compétences, ses systèmes de contrôle et de pilotage de la performance et sa culture. Dans ces cas, deux types de transformation doivent être distingués : une transformation incrémentale et progressive dans le temps et une transformation ponctuée associée à un bouleversement organisationnel. En discussion de la recherche, une typologie d’analyse de l’impact transformationnel des décisions d’externalisation est proposée.

%X Ethiopiahas one of the lowest ratios of health professionals to population in the world. The few medical specialists who are available work mainly in the capital city and in a few regional cities. The use of telemedicine in public health facilities can mitigate the shortage of medical personnel. We conducted a survey of selected public health facilities located inAddis Ababa,Ethiopia. The study could be modified and extended to other countries in Sub-SaharanAfrica. In this study, we adapted Bakry’s e-government assessment model, STOPE (Strategy, Technology, Organizational, People, and Environment) to assess telemedicine readiness. Validity and reliability tests were conducted using the Smart PLS software package. The survey data was analyzed using SPSS version 16, and descriptive and analytical statistical reports were generated. The color-coded feature of the McConnell International analysis tool was used to display the results. All factors in STOPE indicated amber color, which implies the need for substantial improvements at the health facilities in order to adopt Telemedicine. The STOPE model results from this study show that the degree of readiness for telemedicine implementation varies from a weak rating for Technology readiness to strong rating for Organization readiness.

The aim of this article is to investigate the extent to which this rich history and experience is used to inform contemporary practices. We provide a survey that evaluates the degree to which PD (participatory design) is currently represented in the IS literature, the results of which reveal a low representation. Based on these findings, a number of propositions are offered.

%X In 2011 a roundtable meeting of Chief Information Officers (CIOs) that was organized by the Manufacturing Information systems Center at the School of Business Administration at Wayne State University discussed the emergence of public cloud computing and how this is changing the role of the CIO for medium- and large-sized organizations. The nine CIOs represented a range of manufacturing and service industries in the Greater Detroit area. This article summarizes the key themes of that roundtable, namely, the continuing change in role of the CIO as public cloud computing becomes mainstream. Key among those changes is not as much technological, because private clouds have been around now for quite some time, but rather in the broader and more challenging scope of responsibilities the CIOs now have. The role of the CIO is evolving from providing and supporting information technology and systems toward one largely based on managing the integration of externally acquired standardized hardware, software, and services while retaining quality control and remaining within budget, as well as the need to be more acquainted with the legal side of contracting. This changing set of CIO responsibilities has not made the technical skills any less important, but it has added a host of additional skills that the CIOs and those serving under them now need to master.

%X Conceptual modeling is fundamental to information systems requirements engineering. Systems analysts and designers use the constructs and methods of a conceptual modeling formalism to represent, communicate, and validate the contents, capabilities, and constraints of an envisioned information system within its organizational context. The value of such a representation is measured by the degree to which it facilitates a shared understanding among all stakeholders of (1) the organizational information requirements and (2) the ability of the envisioned information system to meet them [Wand and Weber, 2002]. We propose using the social ontology developed by John Searle [1995, 2006, 2010] as the basis for conceptual modeling and present a meta-model based on that ontology.

%X This paper examines the determinants of friendship between two users in a virtual world who are unaware of each other's real identities. Drawing on theories of homophily, heterophily and propinquity, three virtual world behaviours are analysed: avatar appearance, avatar location, and avatar communication. Data are collected on 179 participants interacting in a novel virtual world. The main results show that: (1) avatars did not tend to form friendships with avatars that are similar in appearance to themselves but did tend to form friendships with avatars that are dressed differently from themselves; (2) in terms of location, the closer an avatar stands to other avatars, the more likely the avatar is to receive a friend invitation; and (3) the fewer words an avatar uses in communication, the more likely the avatar is to receive a friend invitation. This paper contributes to theories of virtual world interaction and to using virtual worlds as a data collection platform.

%X The impact of the World Wide Web on basic operational economical components in global information-rich civilizations is significant. The repercussions force organizations to provide justification for security from a business-case perspective and to focus on security from a Web application development environment standpoint. The need for clarity promoted an investigation through the acquisition of empirical evidence from a high level Web survey and a more detailed industry survey to analyze security in the Web application development environment ultimately contributing to the proposal of the Essential Elements (EE) and the Security Criteria for Web Application Development (SCWAD). The synthesis of information provided was used to develop the Web Engineering Security (WES) methodology. WES is a proactive, flexible, process neutral security methodology with customizable components that is based on empirical evidence and used to explicitly integrate security throughout an organization’s chosen application development process.

%X Although growth in U.S. consumers’ overall use of e-health is strong, it is being driven by only a portion of the e-health services that are offered through online health portals. Fine-grained, longitudinal analysis of three representative e-health services shows that, while online communication with medical personnel has grown consistently between 2003 and 2012, the purchase of health supplies online plateaued by 2007, and participation in online support groups has been flat since 2003. Socio-economic factors of income and education level continue to have an impact on consumers’ use of e-health; however, differences based on age, sex, and race/ethnicity are trending lower during this period. The findings caution against the common practice of studying e-health adoption principally at the level of online health portals, which can mask substantial variation in adoption trends among the underlying e-health services, and suggest that it is important to update trend studies on a regular basis to maintain currency.

%X In academe, the scientific impact of a given research article is measured by the number of citations that article has garnered. More citations for an article mean that more researchers have read and used the contents of that article in aiding research. Because of this, some research institutions consider the scientific impact of the works of a researcher in promotion and tenure decisions. Moreover, evaluating the causes of citations can help the community of researchers in a field gain insight into the values and direction of the field. Therefore, an investigation into the causes of citations is valuable to both individual researchers seeking to further their careers and also to the community of researchers at large. This study looks at two types of independent variables in determining the causes of IS article citations: universalistic variables (specific to the scientific contribution of the article) and particularistic variables (specific to the author and/or structure of the paper). Regression analysis finds that while both universalistic and particularistic variables influence the degree to which a paper is cited, particularistic variables are more influential in the IS field.

%X Structural equation models (SEM) are frequently used in information systems (IS) to analyze and test theoretical propositions. As IS researchers frequently reuse measurement instruments and adapt or extend theories, they frequently re-estimate regression relationships in their SEM that have been examined in previous studies. We advocate the use of Bayesian estimation of structural equation models as an aid to cumulative theory building; Bayesian statistics offer a statistically sound way to incorporate prior knowledge into SEM estimation, allowing researchers to keep a “running tally” of the best estimates of model parameters.
%X This tutorial on the application of Bayesian principles to SEM estimation discusses when and why the use of Bayesian estimation should be considered by IS researchers, presents an illustrative example using best practices, and makes recommendations to guide IS researchers in the application of Bayesian SEM.

%X The importance of information systems/information technology (IS/IT) to healthcare organisations is being recognised today as paramount and critical in order to realise superior healthcare delivery. Successful assimilation of IS/IT, which is the central focus of this study, then becomes a key consideration in ensuring that IS/IT is appropriately and systematically deployed into a healthcare organisation. The key findings from this research indicate that there are people, process, technology and environment elements that should be considered as facilitators to the healthcare information systems (HIS) assimilation process, as well as barriers that the healthcare organisation should overcome throughout the entire assimilation process or at specific stages. This research, therefore, is not only topical but especially beneficial to management and administrators in the web of healthcare players as they grapple with trying to successfully assimilate HIS into their respective organisations.

%X n this paper, I take stock of the current state of research on public procurement of information systems (IS). Based on a review of the extant literature, I identify several research gaps. A key finding is that little attention has been paid to the process of public procurement, and most of the papers focusing on the process are limited to one specific task, such as tendering and vendor selection. A substantial proportion of these studies are variance or snapshot types. I emphasize the need for more longitudinal research that covers the whole process, and suggest a research approach that focuses on issues such as stakeholder involvement and management, and the application of dialectics.

%X To manage distributed work, organizations increasingly rely on virtual meetings based on multimodal, synchronous communication technologies. However, despite technological advances, it is still challenging to coordinate knowledge through these meetings with spatial and cultural separation. Against this backdrop, we present a framework for investigating the sharing of dynamic representations of co-created knowledge during such meetings. We illustrate the detailed workings of the framework by analyzing how three software managers coordinated a project over a series of virtual meetings. Grounded in audio recordings of their oral exchanges and video recordings of their shared dynamic representation of the project’s status and plans, our analysis shows how their interrelating of visual and verbal communication acts enabled effective communication and coordination. In conclusion, we offer theoretical propositions that explain how interrelating of verbal and visual acts based on shared dynamic representations enable communication repairs during virtual meetings. We argue that our proposed framework provides researchers with a novel and practical approach to investigate the complex data involved in virtual meetings based on multimodal, synchronous communication.

%X Research has identified a variety of factors that influence people’s intentions to use IS and their degree of IS use. However, what has not been well understood are the characteristics of competent IS users who are proficient in using IS and are able to achieve quality IS usage. Considering that improving IS users’ abilities to more efficiently and effectively use IS has always been and remains a challenge, research that provides a comprehensive view of the characteristics associated with competent IS users is warranted. This paper addresses this research question by proposing a conceptual foundation for IS user competency. Based on social cognitive theory, this research also proposes an overarching framework for IS user competency that can serve as a theoretical foundation for future research in this domain.

%X This study explores the nature of information technology adoption based on phenomena found in the real world. We selected the grounded theory method (GTM) for this study, which involved two sites located in the USA. and eight sites located in Taiwan. The results exemplify a multi-year, multi-site grounded theory approach to generating theory that helps explain information technology (IT) adoption in an organizational context. The core categories of the model are developed from, grounded on, and extracted from the data, and are casually linked into four adoption processes: motivation, solutions fit, values, and decision stage. The nature of the information technology adoption model could help researchers and practitioners understand that managers have one or more motivations, seek IT solutions to fulfill their motivations, evaluate IT solutions, and make decision after judging IT value. We also present an assessment of the theory, and discuss its relevance and directions for future research.

%X Digital platforms need to attract both application developers and end users. Existing literature suggests various strategies related to openness, flexibility, and generativity to attract application developers. However, how consumers make decisions on adopting platforms has not been studied. This paper studies which characteristics of digital platforms consumers most prefer. We focus on mobile platforms where application stores, operator portals, and service provider platforms compete for the consumer’s attention. We conducted a conjoint analysis among 166 consumers to determine the most important characteristics of the mobile platforms. We found that application-related characteristics were most important, especially the number of available applications. Governance-related and technical characteristics were hardly important. Platform characteristics were considerably less important than the brand of the operating system linked to the platform. These  findings were consistent between European and Chinese users, and between males and females. The study paves the way for IS scholars to integrate consumer perspectives in the provider-dominated discourse of digital platforms.

%X E-therapy employs a cross-section of online psychotherapies that use many of the same traditional face-to-face techniques as psychotherapy by exploiting electronic synchronous communication between a patient and trained therapists (counselors, psychoanalyst’s, or other licensed practitioners). A Delphi study of practicing therapists revealed five critical success factors (CSFs) (technological, managerial, empathic, service quality, and legal) that are important influences in the implementation of e-therapy services. Results suggest that managerial and legal factors hinder wider acceptance of e-therapy services. Secure and effective communication channels and protection of patient data emerge as important themes in the context of the five CSFs as concerns of potential e-therapists in wanting to provide effective care to patients.

%X Strategic information system planning (SISP), including aligning business and IS/IT strategies, has been the conventional wisdom known for decades to academics and practitioners. Since the 1980s, many tools and models have been developed to facilitate strategic information system planning and implementation. These are development processes that define a set of steps for SISP or approaches that facilitate part of the SISP process. This article employs a systematic review approach and starts with a search of 2730 papers in nine top-ranked scientific databases. After an in-depth study of these papers, a final set of 85 studies is retrieved that focus directly on SISP development. We use this final set of papers to compare the steps proposed in different processes and the relevant approaches for each step. Additionally, an in-depth analysis of development processes has produced a generic seven-phase framework covering activities introduced in the literature. These seven phases are: initiation, business analysis, IS/IT analysis, strategy formulation, portfolio planning, implementation, and evaluation. The paper also classifies approaches that facilitate SISP and concludes with recommendations for practitioners and researchers.

%X This paper examines how organizational trust and organizational mindfulness shape enterprise resource planning (ERP) system usage. We focus on five dimensions of trust: competence, openness and honesty, concern for employees, reliability, and identification. Drawing on organizational trust and organizational mindfulness theories, we argue that perception of organizational trust among ERP users might explain ERP system usage. We also predict that organizational mindfulness among ERP users positively influences ERP system usage. Our study draws on a total of 231 questionnaires collected from ERP system users across the United States. The results suggest that organizational trust dimensions (namely, competence, concern for employees, and identification) affect ERP system usage. Consistent with the theory, the results also support the idea that organizational trust (i.e., competence, openness and honesty, concern for employees, and identification) create supportive infrastructure-enabling organizational mindfulness. Finally, the study shows key antecedents of organizational mindfulness and underscores the importance of organizational mindfulness as a way of encouraging ERP system usage.

%X Organizations depend on the creative potential of their members to continuously develop innovative solutions. Groups commonly approach creative processes using collaborative IT. However, current design of information systems does not cater to the business processes representing the context in which groups operate. Creativity-intensive processes are a conceptualization of business processes that involve creativity. Voigt, Bergener, and Becker (2013) developed an explanatory design theory for information systems supporting creativity-intensive processes. The core component of the design theory is an information system architecture for creativity-intensive process support systems (CPSS). This paper evaluates the utility of the CPSS architecture to comprehensively support creativity-intensive processes. Three exploratory cross-industry focus groups, in which the architecture instantiation CreativeFlow was demonstrated, suggest that the features of CreativeFlow and the underlying architectural concepts are useful in supporting practitioners’ processes, especially for the support of creative group processes. However, three modifications to the CPSS architecture emerge: increased freedom for choosing individuals responsible for group tasks, differentiated authorization for creating and assigning creative group tasks, and advanced communication support for initiation of standard workflows. The evaluation further contributes recommendations for tool features and four research issues to advance system design of tools supporting creativity in business processes. The study provides insights for future information system evaluations in Design Science Research on Information Systems.

%X To understand how to improve the research process for future projects, it is useful to take a retrospective view of a research project. This is especially true for emerging topics in IS where many opportunities are available to shape directions and priorities. This article presents a reflective analysis of a field research project in the area of knowledge management. The article examines the process history and assesses the decisions taken and activities carried out in the early formative stages of a field research project.  With a detailed anthropological flavor, the paper describes the ins and outs of the various phases of the research process in a narrative experiential way, and analyzes what was learned. The results should be useful for future researchers.  The major lessons learned were: 1.	Retrospectively examining the research of others can be useful in learning how to improve one's ability to do research in a particular area, such as field research in information systems. 2.	Researchers wishing to develop a long term relationship with a host organization may have to be flexible in their research approaches and methods, even to the extent of sacrificing rigor for providing outcomes of use to the host organization. 3.	Pilot studies should be carefully designed and executed to maximize learning for later, more extensive studies.

%X Faced with intense competition in the generics drugs industry, eroding margins, and continuous price pressures, Geneva Pharmaceuticals, the North American subsidiary of Novartis International AG, made a bold, multi-million dollar decision to reengineer all its demand and supply processes using the SAP R/3 system.  This case describes Geneva's journey through the first two of three phases of R/3 implementation from mid-1997 to mid-2000, and the company's plans for Phase III (scheduled for completion by late-2000).  It highlights initial mistakes during this journey, strategies that helped overcome those mistakes, and how R/3 delivered operational efficiencies and competitive advantage under difficult business circumstances.  As the case illustrates, ERP implementation is much more than technology change, it also incorporates substantive process and people changes; and without appropriate change management strategies and experienced leadership, ERP projects are likely to fail.

Their observations are organized into nine categories: (1) interaction with the business community, (2) demand for IS courses, (3) identity of the IS field, (4) cross disciplinary nature of the field, (5) research rigor versus relevance, (6) competitors to IS, (7) cost of information technology, (8) shortage of IS faculty, and (9) shortage of IS leaders. These findings are compared with those from an earlier study with leaders in the IS academic field.  The differences in perspectives have implications and lead to doable recommendations for the field: (1) work on branding IS, (2) strive for more consistency in IS courses across universities, (3) help provide hardware and software resources, and (4) create an electronic journal that publishes technical research.

%X The grocery industry evolved from mom-and-pop stores to mega-markets to online grocery buying, with many different forms along the way.  The global market for groceries in 2000 is over $2 trillion.  The online grocery segment of the market is expected to reach $34 billion by 2002, a thirty-three fold increase from 1998.    This tutorial examines the issues surrounding online groceries and looks closely at fourteen examples from the Americas, Europe, and Australia.   The online market is currently one of growth, not profits.  Two key components of profitability for online vendors are the ability to generate sufficient volume, while keeping delivery costs low. The Internet also impacts business-to-business relations among grocers.   This tutorial describes key online grocery firms including Peapod, NetGrocer, Streamline, WebVan, Ruok@Net, Albert Heijn, Disco, Ykköshalli, Shoplink, Coles and Woolworths. Each of these companies represents different business models, with differing organizational structure and scope of operations.  Each has its own set of strengths and weaknesses. To date, no company stands out from the rest with a proven model of success for dealing with national delivery, providing perishable food products, or achieving acceptable profits.  This article also analyzes the attractiveness of the online grocery market for entry by both Internet companies and traditional grocers.  Environmental factors, store features, and household specific factors are examined in light of technical, cultural, organizational, and economic issues facing grocers and their consumers.

%X The growing interest in Structured Equation Modeling (SEM) techniques and recognition of their importance in IS research raises the need to compare and contrast the different types of SEM techniques so that research designs can be selected appropriately. After assessing the extent to which these techniques are currently being used in IS research, the article presents a running example which analyzes the same dataset via three very different statistical techniques.  It then compares two classes of SEM: covariance-based SEM and partial-least-squares-based SEM. Finally, the article discusses linear regression models and suggests guidelines as to when SEM techniques and when regression techniques should be used. The article concludes with heuristics and rule of thumb thresholds to guide practice, and a discussion of the extent to which practice is in accord with these guidelines.

%X The last decade or so spawned a host of business and technology innovations. On the business side, we saw business process reengineering, the management philosophies of customer          relationship management and supply chain management, virtual organizations, electronic commerce, and business-to-business trading exchanges. On the technology side, we saw client-server computing, enterprise resource planning systems, the widespread adoption of Internet protocols, intranets and enterprise information portals, software package support for customer relationship management, supply chain management and other activities related to electronic         business, and applications service providers.   This tutorial puts put these business and technology innovations into historical context and relates them to one another through the unifying concepts of business integration and systems integration.   One theme of the tutorial is the incomplete linkage between business integration and systems integration. Another is the imperfect relationship between the management philosophies of customer relationship management, supply chain management and electronic business more            broadly and the information technologies that provide applications support for these management            philosophies.

%X This paper reports on conceptual development in the areas of database mining, and knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). Our efforts have also led to a prototype implementation, called MOTC, for exploring hypothesis space in large and complex data sets. Our KDD conceptual development rests on two main principles. First, we use the crosstab representation for working with qualitative data. This is by now standard practice in OLAP (on-line analytical processing) applications and we reaffirm it with additional reasons. Second, and innovatively, we use Prediction Analysis as a measure of goodness for hypotheses. Prediction Analysis is an established statistical technique for analysis of associations among qualitative variables. It generalizes and subsumes a large number of other such measures of association, depending upon specific assumptions the user is willing to make. As such, it provides a very useful framework for exploring hypothesis space in a KDD context. The paper illustrates these points with an extensive discussion of MOTC.

%X McFarlan's IT Project Risk Assessment Framework (Applegate, et al., 1996), identifies three main areas of IT project risk: project size, project structure, and technology familiarity. According to this framework, if two IT projects are of similar size, a project which is designed primarily around emerging technologies will entail significantly higher risks than a project which is designed primarily around traditional technologies. This paper analyzes two comparably-sized IT projects. One - a telemedicine initiative at Fletcher-Allen Health Care in Vermont -- is designed primarily around emerging technologies. The other - the year 2000 compliance program at the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) - is focused primarily on fixing and testing existing systems on traditional platforms. Our assessment identified two additional salient criteria which, when applied to the two projects revealed higher risks at the MTA. These criteria are time constraints (i.e., the immovable deadline of the year 2000) and system interdependence (i.e., the need for applications to share data with other applications, both within the MTA and with numerous external parties). When these two factors are taken into account, it becomes evident that Year 2000 initiatives represent far higher project risks than the emerging technology projects that are considered to be on the "bleeding edge."

Such an instrument does not force managers to confront the relationships between issues. Q-sort and interpretive structured modeling (ISM) force managers to consider the linkages among key issues. This article discusses the use of these methodologies for investigating key issues and demonstrates their application with data collected from Brazilian banking IT managers. This study illustrates how these approaches provide additional insights into the key concerns facing IT managers.

%X Multimedia has become an integral part of computing and communications environment, and networks are carrying ever-increasing volume of multimedia information. The main characteristics of multimedia information are high-volume and bursty traffic, with low tolerance to delay and delay variance. The legacy networks (designed in 70s and 80s) are not able to meet these requirements. Enhancements to the older networking technologies have been developed to convert these into multimedia networks. Enhancements to LANs include Switched Ethernet, Isochronous Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, 100VGAnyLAN, FDDI-II, and Synchronous FDDI. WAN options for multimedia networking include digital leased lines and ISDN. The Internet has revolutionized business and personal communications, but falls short of being a genuine multimedia network. To make the Internet capable of carrying multimedia traffic, new protocols such as MBone, ST-II, RTP, and RSVP have been developed. Internet2 is a new initiative that is aimed at overcoming the problems of throughput, delay and jitter encountered on the original Internet. One technology that was developed with multimedia networking as one of its main applications, is the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technology. Upcoming Gigabit Ethernet technology will provide a path for upgrading current Ethernet networks into multimedia networks.

%X This paper describes the underlying concepts, architecture, and design of a Web-enabled CyberCollaboratory (Web-CCAT) for geographically distributed information systems students and working professionals. The primary objectives for Web-CCAT are (1) to provide the opportunity to participate in and enjoy the benefits of cooperative learning without having to coordinate meeting times or come to campus; and (2) to provide a more technologically enriched collaborative environment than is possible in a traditional face-to-face classroom.  To meet these objectives, multi-user, collaborative software tools and procedures were designed for use in the asynchronous mode of communication. Web-CCAT is implemented as a tool kit of commercially available applications coupled with software developed at the University of Illinois at Springfield. The system became operational in January 1999.

%X This paper proposes a general, yet useful theory of information systems. It is a response to repeated lamentations and debates about whether it is possible to find a set of core concepts for the IS field. Business and IT professionals can apply this theory for understanding and analyzing information systems. Academic researchers can apply it for gaining a deeper appreciation of past research and for developing future research projects. This theory tries to be equally applicable to all information systems, and not just to a particular type of application such as TPS, MIS, DSS, EIS, GSS, or ERP. It also tries to be equally applicable to information systems of today, of 20 years ago, and of the near term future.

The assumptions concern the scope and risks of IT projects, the rationales for and uses of IT, and the role of history and time in systems-related outcomes. Making different assumptions about these issues suggests the need for new approaches to IS research.

%X The purpose of this scientometric study is to examine which Carnegie Classification categories are represented by researchers in the leading information systems journals, determine which categories published the most in those journals, and whether different categories have different publishing patterns and frequencies. We reviewed publications from the seven leading IS journals (CAIS, DSS, Information & Management, ISR, JAIS, JMIS, and MIS Quarterly) during calendar years 2001 to 2005.  As expected, Carnegie Classification categories designated as research universities with very high and high research activities dominated the publications in the leading journals. However, we also found that other categories were also major contributors and that there was a significant amount of collaboration across categories.  Based upon our findings, we created a publication productivity profile for each of the Carnegie Classification Categories that published in the leading IS journals during calendar years 2001-2005.

%X There is much debate about social responsibility in the context of business and industry but not much in the context of information technology. We address this void by examining developments and innovations at the interface between information technologies and positive social change. In particular, the paper explores the role of information technology in three critical domains: connectivity, education, and economic development. The underlying premise of the authors is that information and communication technologies can serve agents of social innovation in underserved communities and that their consideration is vital to the success of many efforts that pursue global and sustainable change. We also submit that such issues ought to be integrated more centrally into the practice and scholarly mission of the IS discipline.

%X The networks of communication and interpersonal relationships that develop naturally within an organization form channels for the flow of organizational knowledge and can also promote organizational learning. These informal social networks are significant mechanisms for both innovation and change management. However, until recently, very little has been done to try to facilitate or leverage social networks to take advantage of what they can do to deliver organizational value. Today, pressures on modern business to continually innovate and the increasing capability of information technologies to enable broader and more far-flung communication are driving organizations to look for ways to leverage social networks to improve business performance. Social networking concepts combined with a group of new and powerful interactive technologies, known collectively as peer-to-peer (P2P) computing, have the potential to profoundly change how companies work and deliver value. The effective harmonization of knowledge management with P2P technologies could therefore be the "killer app" that makes executives realize the importance of knowledge management (KM) to their organizations. However, their contribution to this partnership in the future will largely be dependent on knowledge managers' ability to demonstrate their skill at leveraging and facilitating social networks today. This paper combines the ideas and experiences of a group of practicing knowledge managers with research from the academic literature on social networks to create an overview of the issues and practices that are critical to facilitating the development of social networks and understanding their value in organizations. It examines the different types of social networks currently operating in organizations and the value of these networks to the enterprise and then looks at ways of developing and facilitating social networks in organizations. Finally, it examines the strategic potential of networks in organizations and how KM might help realize this value.

One factor in this lack of adoption is an insufficient supply of knowledgeable information technology professionals in the healthcare environment. To help resolve this shortage of professionals, an undergraduate degree to address technology, operations, and healthcare is proposed. This program builds on existing coursework in a state university to provide undergraduate students with the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities to assist in the adoption, implementation, and ongoing maintenance of EMRs in the healthcare environment.

%X The emergence of the World Wide Web as a major communication and transaction channel stresses the preeminent importance of a company's Web site for representing the organization, interacting with customers and conducting transactions. In comparison to other channels, the opportunities for targeting specific market segments are somehow limited, due to the Internet's worldwide reach and predominantly anonymous users. Additionally, an ever-increasing number of customers are going online, which prevents the fine tuning of a site for specific user groups. Therefore, it seems essential that organizations possessing Web presence should be well aware of their site's general functionality and how it is perceived by Internet users. For many years the analysis of Web sites has been one of the major topics for both scholars and practitioners, which led to a huge number of different techniques being used for the evaluation of sites. Furthermore, a variety of different theories and models have been developed which include the effects of Web sites as dependent or independent variables. In this paper, I compare different approaches to Web site analysis and present a classification framework. Numerous examples will be given to illustrate the various dimensions of the framework. Furthermore, benefits and drawbacks of the respective methods will be discussed where applicable. The results provide important insights into the current state of the art of Web analysis and will be supportive for anyone planning to conduct a Web analysis as well as for someone who is interested in getting an overview of the research field.

%X The information systems academic discipline faced a sharp reduction in student enrollments as the job market for undergraduate students softened. This article examines the recent and rapid rise and fall of university student enrollments in information systems programs and describes how these enrollment fluctuations are tied to the job opportunities of graduates.  Specifically, we examine the role that global outsourcing is playing on the employment opportunities, both in the United States and Europe.  This analysis concludes that the demand for information systems graduates in the United States likely bottomed out and slow growth is now occurring. In Europe, general conclusions are limited, but it appears that global outsourcing is playing much less a role in Europe than in the United States.  Nevertheless, although global outsourcing is indeed a factor influencing the U.S. employment picture, it is only one of several factors that impacted the U.S. job market for information systems graduates negatively over the past few years. After examining the future job opportunities for information systems graduates from a macro viewpoint, the paper provides recommendations for improving student recruiting to the information systems major, for attracting potential employers of graduates, and for managing the production of Ph.D. graduates to match the flow of undergraduate demand.  The article concludes that, although shaken, the information systems academic discipline is strong and will continue to strengthen as it moves into a state of maturity and relative equilibrium.

%X Demonstrating the value of knowledge management (KM) to the organization represents an elusive challenge. In part, this challenge is due to the nature of knowledge management itself and the difficulty in creating direct linkages between knowledge sharing and sales growth or productivity. But it is also undoubtedly due to misaligned KM activities. This paper first reviews the current state of metrics in KM and presents six principles of measurement immediately applicable to the practice of KM. It then outlines a framework for KM evaluation using four key approaches: balanced scorecard; strategic imperatives; capabilities assessment; and measurement matrix. The paper concludes by presenting a number of strategies for improving KM metrics.

%X USA Swimming (USAS) is the National Governing Body for the sport of swimming, one of more than 40 National Governing Bodies for amateur sports in the United States. Their mission is, in part, to "administer competitive swimming in accordance with the Amateur Sports Act", and to "provide programs and services for our members, supporters, affiliates and the interested public" The USAS membership community consists of athletes, non-athletes, and clubs. One of the most important functions USAS performs is to gather and maintain information on members in all categories. Maintaining individual swimmers' times in sanctioned meets, for example, forms the basis for swimmers to be ranked nationally. The responsibility for the gathering of data is relegated to 2,800 clubs and 59 local swimming committees scattered across the US. In their previous system, data needed for the USAS master databases was gathered by the clubs and sent to the local swimming committees, which consolidated the data and forwarded it to the national headquarters in Colorado Springs. Unfortunately, by 2002, it became clear that the hodgepodge of different hardware platforms and software used by the clubs and local swimming committees made the data gathering process ripe for errors, which resulted in unreliable data in multiple database systems at USAS headquarters. This case describes the process USAS management followed to establish and manage the development of a new system whose principal features include a new centralized database with a pre-posting "holding tank" for data cleansing as well as a Web portal providing valuable new functionality to the user community. The project involved significant risks, not the least of which was the widely dispersed user community. Risks were mitigated by the development of a prototype and by engaging an independent verification and validation firm. The new system achieved the benefits that USAS projected when the project was first conceived. The complicated technical infrastructure was replaced by a Web-based architecture that provides faster and more reliable service to the USAS community at a lower cost. The problem of inaccuracies in the data caused by data being stored in multiple databases was eliminated with the establishment of the new centralized database and the "holding tank's" data cleansing capabilities. Users at USAS headquarters and in the field embraced the new system because it simplified the data gathering process and greatly improved the reliability of the information they obtain from the centralized database. Further, the Web-based portal provides a stable operating environment for day-to-day operations and a platform that allows adding enhancements easily to the system.

%X This case describes the privacy issues surrounding Giant Food's decision to outsource a prescription drug compliance program to Elensys.  Under the arrangement, Elensys would send refill reminders to Giant's pharmacy customers.  As approximately half of all patients stop taking their medication within the first six months of being prescribed, compliance programs which remind patients to refill their prescriptions help address a major public health issue.  However, these programs also raise privacy issues because they involve the reuse of sensitive personal information. The case provides students with an opportunity to assess the privacy issues raised by this situation.  The case also provides an opportunity for students to grapple with the challenges of developing a "privacy sensitive" implementation strategy for Giant and for CRM programs more generally.

%X With an increasing number of vehicles with significant computing and communication, many applications such as vehicular Internet hot-spots, digital and entertainment content's broadcast, Intelligent Transportation Systems applications, and highway management will become possible. This "vehicular mobile commerce" will actively involve vehicles and users in both extending the existing mobile commerce applications to the vehicular environment and creating many more new and suitable applications. Before vehicular mobile commerce becomes a practical reality, many technical, structural and user issues must be addressed. In this paper, we identify and discuss several vehicular mobile commerce applications as well as wireless and networking challenges.  We present possible solutions for vehicular mobile commerce and define several research problems that should be undertaken.

%X This paper describes how to use Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis to evaluate radiologists' performance of interpreting digital mammograms in real-time. We developed an experimental testing system, which implemented a set of clinical lesion-matching rules to prepare raw ROC data. The system can automatically provide detailed evaluations of the performance, such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, diagnostic accuracy, ROC curve, and area under the curve (Az). Based on a preliminary evaluation of the system, we found that ROC analysis is appropriate for a real-time computer application, directly using the raw data from a database, to evaluate the performance of radiology residents.

%X IS academics are under increasing pressure to apply for national competitive grants, internal university grants, and industry funding to support their research programs. This paper presents an investigation of the nature of DSS research funding through the analysis of 1,020 papers published in 14 high quality journals from 1990 to 2003. In the sample, 23.6% of DSS papers acknowledged grant support, 14.7% were supported by major competitive grants, and only 5.1% received industry grant support. This level of grant funding may be a major problem for the DSS field. Even more worrying is the finding that overall grant support is falling over time. The detailed analysis of DSS research funding shows what types of DSS are grant-funded, where the grant-funded papers are published, what paradigms and methods are grant-funded in DSS research, the relationship between research quality and funding type, and the relationship between grant funding and research relevance. The findings and conclusions relate to DSS research, but because of the proportion of IS research that concerns DSS, they are also important for IS research in general.

%X When managers and stockholders consider making an investment in information technology (IT), as with any other investment, a major concern is whether this investment will add to the performance of their organization.  However, it is difficult to identify the nature of the linkage between an investment in IT in general, and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), in particular, to an organization's performance. In this study we extend the work of Barua et al. , Lerch and Mangal, and Tallon et al. We develop a model to identify the value ERP applications add to Porter's organizational primary activities and the information systems (IS) applications related to ERP that help deliver added value through organizational characteristics. This new model should help in  assessing the potential value of an ERP investment.   We examine the relationship of ERP applications and organizational characteristics to an organization's primary activities by a path analysis of more than 200 medium and large sized manufacturing firms.  The results of this investigation indicate that organizational characteristics mediate the relationship between IS applications and the value ERP can add to the organizational primary activities. Consequently, organizations with different characteristics may add different value to their primary activities by using ERP applications.  We found that each primary activity was supported by some, though not necessarily all, IS applications included in most ERP packages.  We conclude that, an organization's characteristics are related to the return that may be gained from the use of ERP systems.  We offer recommendations on how organizations can use ERP to add value to their primary activities, based on their organizational characteristics.

%X Decision Support Systems (DSS) in health care must be designed in consideration of the empirical context and problem space where they are being applied. However differences such as workflow, clinical expertise and organizational norms make it hard to define the context where a DSS will be used. What is needed is a DSS that is able to enhance health care delivery in different contexts. In this paper we present a multi-modal DSS that supports decision making in different contexts. The paper describes the theoretical basis for the DSS, explores a problem space in palliative care and describes a prototype implementation of the DSS to address the issues from the problem space.

%X With the deployment of 3G and 4G mobile networks, a sizable proportion of e-commerce traffic is expected to move to these networks. These transactions are likely to be diverse. Mobile transactions can include unique requirements such as atomicity (all or none steps), push or pull, security, and privacy. Because users are mobile, unpredictable link characteristics, and other problems associated with wireless networks, some mobile commerce transactions may not be completed causing significant annoyance to the users affected. Therefore, the probability of completing mobile transactions is an important parameter for measuring quality-of-service of a network supporting mobile commerce. The transaction completion probability measures the ability of networks to support completion of transactions. This research focuses on improving the support of mobile commerce transactions by the underlying wireless networks. Mobile commerce traffic is classified as messaging, information connectivity, and transactions in order to provide efficient quality-of-service to various applications. This paper introduces the use of priority, sociability and delegation to improve the transaction completion in wireless networks.

Guidelines for writing proposals include writers becoming involved in the grant review process to gain a better understanding of how the granting process works and avoiding such pitfalls as writing proposals to increase salary, recognition, or university standing. The proposal writing process is a challenging task and this paper, based on a grant writing workshop at AMCIS 2005, provides support for navigating the process.

%X Scheduling courses ("timetabling") at a University is a persistent challenge.  Allocating course-sections to prescribed "time slots" for courses requires advanced quantitative techniques, such as goal programming, and collecting a large amount of multi-criteria data at least six to eight months in advance of a semester.  This study takes an alternate approach.  It demonstrates the feasibility of applying the principles of data mining. Specifically it uses association rules to evaluate a  non-standard ("aberrant") timetabling pilot study undertaken in one College at a University.  The results indicate that 1), inductive methods are indeed applicable, 2), both summary and detailed results can be understood by key decision-makers, and 3), straightforward, repeatable SQL queries can be used as the chief analytical technique on a recurring basis.  In addition, this study was one of the first empirical studies to provide an accurate measure of the discernable, but negligible, scheduling exclusionary effects that may impact course availability and diversity negatively.

%X Xpedite was a computer-based information system developed by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) to enhance organ procurement and placement from cadavers.  Using state-of-the-art development approaches and technology at the time of its development, Xpedite was built around Lotus Notes,  facsimile machines, and alphanumeric pagers.  It was developed to integrate and streamline the collection, transfer, and exchange of data on available organs more fully. The concept was to shorten the time from organ availability (i.e., donor death) to transplant, thus reducing organ wastage.  Xpedite met design and operational performance goals (i.e., a reduction in placement times and data errors), yet its operation was terminated after barely twenty-four months of operation.  Adoption of the new technology throughout the transplant community was limited due to inexperience with integrated information technology systems and the resistance to change that accompanied Xpedite's launch.  The individual and organizational resistance was a surprise to UNOS.  The technical and organizational lessons learned from this experience helped UNOS with developing subsequent information technology infrastructure components.  The complexity of the technology support environment and low levels of user adoption for Xpedite ultimately led to an evolution beyond this tool, resulting in an Internet-based environment that would be more robust, easier to maintain, and better able to support user needs.

The Award presents a natural moment of reflection on past CRM achievements and future plans. The case allows us to  (1) dissect a CRM success story, that contrasts nicely with many of the CRM horror stories of the 1990s, and identify key success factors;  (2) focus attention onto the viability of the planned approach KLM uses for implementing CRM;  (3) introduce and show the importance of program management as a construct for structurally growing and governing enterprise-wide investment in CRM; and  (4) help reinforce lessons around CRM and business-ICT alignment.

%X The paper provides baseline conditions of  U.S. e-commerce in the post-dot.com era. The article examines the key factors that act as determinants of e-commerce diffusion. It is based on qualitative analysis of  U.S. industry survey data, matched to a similar data and analyses from other countries. It presents data taken from one of the most comprehensive sample surveys of U.S. firm activity in e-commerce.  The paper analyzes differences among three industry sectors, and between small/medium and large firms using both qualitative interpretations and direct observations from the survey data, as well as use of structural equation modeling of e-commerce diffusion and impacts.   Some differences in e-commerce orientation and experience were found across the three industry sectors studied in the survey. These differences are related largely to the nature of the tasks done in the respective industries, and to prior industry-level investment and learning related to e-commerce. There were also differences found in e-commerce attitudes and experience between small/medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and large establishments. Only modest differences were found between U.S. and non-U.S. establishments.  Quantitative analysis revealed significant regression relationships with their level of statistical significance. Results show that e-commerce adoption is path dependent (i.e., establishments follow earlier investment patterns), and that each industry's market and institutional context play a significant role in adoption.

The seven-year period of the study includes the strong job market of the Internet boom, as well as the weak job market following the Internet bust.  The regression results indicate that several factors are significantly related to starting salary including internship experience, GPA, job market, and size of employer.  Internship experience was found to play a particularly strong role in predicting MIS starting salaries.  A significant interaction effect indicates that the positive effect of internship experience is stronger during a weak job market.  Graduates with internship experience also found employment more quickly.  The study is based upon academic and placement data collected from 126 graduates from an AACSB accredited MIS program at Western Washington University during the years 1997-2003.

%X Business enterprises continue to globalize, motivated by their search for new markets, greater efficiency in the use of resources, and greater competitiveness. Information systems and technologies serve as one of the critical success factors for making this possible.  Some IS curricula supported this development by either integrating more globalization into current courses or by delivering stand-alone courses in Global IS Management as electives or requirements.  The purpose of this paper is to review and propose "best practices" for the Global IS Management course, and consider contingencies that can be expected to influence the choice and success of various approaches.  The paper provides a categorization of such courses based on differences in education level (graduate/undergraduate) and student population (MIS/InternationalBusiness/ mixed).  We discuss experiences with approaches and practices that work across these segments, and activities targeted to each segment.   The paper revisits and argues for the need to expand this curriculum, and provides practical details for MIS faculty who seek to integrate it into their own programs.

%X The e-government field, like most young fields, lacks a strong body of well-developed theory. One strategy for coping with theoretical immaturity is to import and adapt theories from other, more mature fields. This study reviews Stakeholder Theory (ST) and investigates its potential in relation to e-Government. Originally a management theory, stakeholder theory advocates addressing the concerns of all stakeholders in a firm, as opposed to concentration on the interests of senior managers and stockholders. Apart from its original profit focus, there is no serious conceptual mismatch between stakeholder theory and government's objective of providing policy and services for citizens and organizations - society's stakeholders. Potential problems with adapting a management theory to a government setting are discussed. The paper further discusses how information technology impacts a stakeholder model of governance. Finally, the paper makes recommendations for future work in adapting ST to the e-government context.

%X While information and communication technologies can increase the health care provided to underserved populations, research concerning these technologies often involves only those patients who possess access to technology or who are otherwise willing and able to use it. This issue is important for both researchers and practitioners because non-users' beliefs may not only be different from users' beliefs, they may become more important to understand as access to technology increases. To address this problem: 1. We develop a model of the antecedents to perceived usefulness of an interactive health communication (IHC) system. While our research model combines health-related beliefs with technology perceptions, the antecedents can all be measured before an individual has contact with a particular IHC system. Thus, in the current (and in future) work, they can be used to assess the beliefs of individuals who may not currently be willing or able to use technology. 2. We test this model using paper-based scenarios that depict hypothetical interactions with an IHC system. These paper-based scenarios are more flexible and easier to use than a working system, thus we are able to obtain data from many sources, resulting in a perceptually diverse sample. Results of our hypothesis testing show that patients with higher knowledge and discipline are less likely than those with less knowledge and/or discipline to find an IHC system useful. In addition we learned several lessons from our research process including how to increase participation rates and what reactions to expect from participants.

%X The project to develop the Colorado Benefits Management System (CBMS) was begun with high hopes and the best of intentions. Its vision was to replace six aging legacy systems supporting various State administered welfare programs with a single system using current technologies. The expected benefits from CBMS were better service to clients and assurance that the State's welfare programs were being administered properly. The bulk of the development effort was outsourced to a large systems integration firm, and a comprehensive project oversight structure was put in place. Despite these actions, the project was troubled from the start. Nearing one more projected conversion date, the two executive sponsors of the project were faced with a decision of whether or not to implement the system despite protests from the user community that CBMS was not ready to be put into operation.

The authors use root cause analysis to identify the causes of KM project abandonment in five well-documented cases of KM drawn from the literature.  The findings are synthesized into a Cause-Effect Diagram (CED), culminating in a causal model of KM project abandonment.  The model identifies three major categories for causes of KM project abandonment, namely (1) poor project implementation, (2) mismatch between the KM project and the organization's strategy or existing structure, and (3) content deficiencies related to the creation, capture and access of knowledge content.  These three major categories of causes are iteratively refined and eventually root causes emerge.  KM project abandonment is compared with IS project failure, and the implications for risk management practices for KM projects are discussed.

%X Wireless mobile computing promises to usher in the next major paradigm in personal computing. Handheld computers in particular are truly portable and they are becoming increasingly capable of meeting most users' computing needs. In this paper we outline a vision for deploying wireless mobile computing technology within the realm of professional conferences by creating a Mobile Conference Information System (MCIS). With detailed descriptions of applications and hypothetical usage scenarios, we describe how the system can be used to access conference information, to network people, and enhance common conference services. We also describe several constraints, limitations, and challenges with this concept, and we suggest how these problems can be overcome. In this paper we consolidate many current applications of wireless networked computing into one comprehensive system; we highlight several of the complexities and challenges that apply to any wirelessly mobile information system; and we offer a vision for a valuable platform for future research on the use of mobile technologies. The MCIS will significantly change how conferences are managed and enhance the experiences of the attendees.

%X The diffusion of e-commerce in Denmark is mainly a result of a partnership between government and industry initiatives, rather than being purely market- or government-led. While environmental factors are important enablers of e-commerce diffusion, government policy aims to be a key driving force.   Although the size of government is substantial and the list of policy instruments is extensive, there is a serious question about whether the governments' efforts to stimulate use within the society (business, consumers, and government itself) are sufficient to stimulate diffusion of e-commerce adequately. Our analysis questions the effectiveness of the government-led approach because of its timing, its lack of coordinated actions, and the mixed motives of government actions, in particular at the European Community level.  	Our analysis also found serious structural barriers such as high marginal income taxation and a limited supply of qualified labor. Contributing to the limited labor supply are strict immigration policies and late entry into the labor market (college graduates enter the job market at the mean age of 29). Adding to the structural problems is the lack of large high-tech manufacturing companies that can function as locomotives, as well as an insufficient equity and venture funding market. 	The Danish national e-commerce strategy is focused on rapid adoption, implementation, and exploitation of e-commerce in all sectors of the economy, rather than a production-led strategy. The official goals of the Danish government are to make IT available to all citizens and to be among the top five IT-using nations in the world. Although our analysis points to a high level of diffusion of the technologies that, in principle could enable e-commerce, actual exploitation is lagging behind the lavish display of technology.

%X The United States is a global leader in both Business-to-Customer (B2C) and Business-to-Business (B2B) electronic commerce. 	This leadership comes in part from the historical US strengths in information technology, telecommunications, financial services, and transportation - all of which are essential enabling components of e-commerce. 	The size and strength of the US economy, the wealth of its consumer base, and the relatively open access to venture capital creates an attractive environment for e-commerce investment. 	Official US Government policy toward e-commerce is to let the private sector take the lead, with government helping to make the business climate right for innovation and investment.  	Prior US Government investments in essential e-commerce infrastructure for military purposes (e.g., digital computing, the Internet) and for civilian purposes (e.g., interstate highways, air transport) played an important role in the US lead in e-commerce. 	US Government policies favoring widespread economic liberalization since the 1970's in areas such as financial services, transportation, and telecommunications helped enable and stimulate private sector investment and innovation in e-commerce. 	The collapse of the dot.com era in the late 1990's hit key sectors of e-commerce hard, suggesting that some of the more dramatic and positive predictions of e-commerce growth and impact will either be delayed substantially or will not come to pass. 	The strength of surviving e-commerce companies (e.g., Amazon and eBay), as well as the relative stability of the technology sector (e.g., Cisco Systems, Dell, Intel, IBM) and the continued investment of large industry sectors (e.g., autos, finance) suggest that e-commerce is still growing and is here to stay. 	Consumers are intrigued by B2C e-commerce, and many have used such services, but serious concerns related to privacy and transaction security remain obstacles to universal adoption of B2C e-commerce.

%X The international environment is the most important factor that drives the diffusion of B2B e-commerce in Taiwan. The digital information network that enables supply-chain management is used by Taiwanese firms as a means to protect their position in global production. National environment elements, such as telecommunication infrastructures and human resources, are useful reinforcing factors, but not powerful enough to drive the whole process. Government policies play a role only to the extent that they encourage a certain approach to e-commerce solutions.  In the case of B2C e-commerce, Internet penetration among the general population is a precondition for diffusion. On-line security concerning trading and payment is critical for the acceptance of electronic commerce by Internet users and the national environment is crucial in this regard. Nevertheless, the most effective driver for the diffusion of electronic trade appears to be innovation of the right products. Without such products, the diffusion of e-commerce will be limited, even with the right environment and policies.

The committee was established in response to an inquiry on plagiarism that was placed before the Council. The report includes an overview of the literature on plagiarism, the views of eight editors of IS journals, and guidelines for dealing with the issue. The Committee makes four recommendations: 1.	Creation of a new standing committee of the AIS Council to deal with member misconduct. 2.	A pledge of originality for every paper submitted to AIS for publication 3.	A change in the way members are dismissed from AIS so it becomes the responsibility of Council 4.	A member poll to determine what is considered acceptable behavior as the first step in creating an AIS code of ethics.

%X Peer-to-peer (P2P) gurus suggest that inexpensive computing power, bandwidth, and storage will enable radically new enterprise forms that are driven by the distribution of interactive computing power more or less equally through the enterprise. Based on the capabilities of the Internet (as opposed to the web), which forms a vast network of computers that can be linked in many different ways, P2P has been called "a third age in Internet time" and "the next logical evolution of the Internet". While such predictions may be somewhat hyper-optimistic, the speed with which this technology already spread from underground to mainstream is remarkable. Whether they like it or not, companies will soon need to determine how they are going to deal with P2P, just as they did with other major technology shifts (e.g., PCs, e-commerce). This paper is designed to help researchers and managers understand the challenges P2P technology poses for CIOs and organizations. It first gives an overview of these technologies, including their current status, probable applications and the opportunities and challenges involved in using them. Then, it discusses the strategic potential of P2P for organizations and explores some of the areas in which P2P could have a significant impact on how business and IT functions work. It concludes with some advice to CIOs about how to begin integrating P2P into their organization and some suggestions for researching the impacts of this technology on business.

%X This research note examines an apparent paradox in Information Systems (IS) research. This paradox relates to the parochial nature of much of the published IS research (both in terms of the chosen journal outlet and the literature cited), notwithstanding the global nature of the phenomena being investigated.  It does so by reviewing author 'nationality' in four leading IS journals over a seven-year period (1994-2000), and by reviewing the 'nationality' of the literature cited by these authors. Two of the journals are published in the USA and two are published in Europe. Despite apparent recognition of increasing globalization in our field, brought about - in part at least - by information technology (IT), the data provide firm evidence that the IS discipline is marked by a distinct parochialism along national, or at least, regional lines. A reorientation appears to be required if leading IS journals are not to continue to be the unwitting mouthpieces of unwitting researchers, publishing the results of partial, culturally biased research. The findings also contain profound implications for published material based on citation analyses and on our understanding of what constitutes the appellation 'international' in our discipline.

%X There is continual pressure to re-examine the MBA curriculum and, in particular, to reduce the core compulsory part. One of the courses taken out may be information systems. By quoting from the emails of 48 respondents from 11 countries of over 100 respondents in total to an ISWorld listserv request, we look at situations in many institutions and the varied opinions of colleagues. We learn about some success and failure stories, of colleagues who argue that IS should not be in the core curriculum (as well as the more common contrary view), and of attitudes of colleagues in other groups. Finally, we use these responses to develop a case for including IS in the MBA core. This article should be of use by colleagues who need to defend IS at their institutions.

%X Exceptional application software developers are a scarce resource.   It is therefore important for employers to identify, retain, and cultivate individuals who exhibit this capacity.  This study compared the personality characteristics of exceptional, experienced application software developers with the personality characteristics of junior and senior level IS and CS students (who can be seen as entry-level, or pre-entry level, IT developers).   We used the Adjective Checklist to measure personality characteristics for all subjects, then mapped the resultant scales to the Five Factor Model of Personality.  The results of this study suggest that exceptional application software developers exhibit significantly higher levels of Extraversion and Conscientiousness.  Exceptional students (as determined by GPA), however, were actually found to be introverted.  Thus, when GPA is used to pre-screen or filter for entry-level positions, recruiters may actually be excluding some of those candidates who are most likely to become exceptional application software developers. These results have implications for understanding and managing the recruiting of IT personnel and their progression from entry level (novice) to more experienced positions.

%X Information systems (IS) researchers find a large number of factors are related to the effectiveness of IS implementations; however, many researchers also lament the lack of theoretical relationships among the factors.  In addition, recent studies of IS implementation produced conflicting results regarding the relative importance and manageability of IS implementation factors.  To address these issues, we encourage researchers to think "out-of-the-box" as we propose a new way of viewing the traditional IS implementation factors.  The nature of the relationships among the factors is analogous to Maslow's generally accepted theories of individual motivation in which certain factors are necessary but not sufficient conditions for given levels of achievement.

%X In this article we examine changes in the patterns of collaboration among information systems researchers since 1987, in terms of number of authors and order of authorship. The proportion of multiple authored papers, particularly among articles published in more prestigious journals, increased significantly. One possible explanation may be in increased research complexity, as evidenced by much longer papers. At the same time, among prestigious journals, the alphabetical model for ordering authorship all but disappeared. The article calls for consideration of a standard for authorship order in IS research.

%X Information management (IM) is gaining increasing attention in both IT and the business functions these days. While IT is involved with almost every aspect of IM, information is the heart and soul of business, and its management cannot be delegated or abdicated to IT. Thus, IM represents the true nexus of business and IT. Because of this, IM has all the hallmarks of an emerging discipline - the offspring of a committed long-term relationship between business and IT. And, it requires new skills and competencies, new frames of reference, and new processes. IM provides the mechanisms for managing enterprise information and a foundation that can be used by both IT and knowledge management to create business value. The "IM function" is responsible for the complete information life cycle: acquisition or creation; organization; navigation; access; security; administration; storage; and retention. Because it still falls into the gray area between business and IT, many organizations find it is essential to develop an enterprise-wide framework that clarifies the policies, principles, roles, responsibilities and accountabilities, and practices for IM in both groups. This paper reports on the findings of a focus group session of IT managers who looked at IM from the enterprise point of view, addressing the business and IT issues and challenges in managing information effectively. It first examines the scope and nature of IM and how it is being conceptualized in organizations. Then, it presents a framework for the comprehensive management of information and identifies the key issues currently facing organizations in implementing an effective IM program. Finally, it presents some recommendations for getting started in IM.

%X A focus on top line growth necessarily brings IT into the mainstream of product/service innovation, which in turn means that IT must assume a customer focus, assimilate new skills, and build collaborations with the business development arm of the organization. It also leads IT into the realm of organizational innovation and the world of strategic experimentation with IT. This paper introduces the concept of strategic experimentation with IT by embedding it within the innovation life cycle typical of most organizations. It then outlines some of the unique issues and challenges IT managers face as they tackle innovation. The paper concludes by presenting a collection of strategies for motivating, supporting, and directing strategic experimentation with IT.

%X In their organizing vision model, Swanson and Ramiller called for more research on the relationship between interorganizational "authorized" (legitimated) discourse on IT and organizational practices. In this paper, the research question is focused on national differences in the way cross-organizational discourses interact with local practices. The methodology used includes the identification of so-called "authorized" ideas through an analysis of both French and U.S. publications (using thematic and lexicometric analysis), as well as IT forums, from 1999 to 2003. This analysis is then merged with an overview of French and American case studies. The results demonstrate strong differences in the OV production systems, as well as in organizational behaviour's reaction to cross-organizational discourse.

%X This paper looks to the history of the development of Information Systems in Hong Kong as a contextual base for examining the Information Systems discipline in Hong Kong. The historical analysis highlights the newness of Information Systems as an academic discipline in Hong Kong, dating back little more than 20 years.  The study reports on data from eight of the ten universities in Hong Kong. All Information Systems groups in Hong Kong universities are shown to be located in business schools, with almost all groups having no separate Information Systems identity. Few Information Systems academics in Hong Kong are reported to have senior faculty positions. In keeping with the placement of Information Systems groups, and reflective of Hong Kong's status as a world finance centre, Information Systems curricula are shown to have a level of consistency across the state, with a heavy business component. By contrast, the study reports diversity in Information Systems research topics and research methods. Although the data analysed suggests that that the Information Systems discipline is immature in Hong Kong, evidence of a strong turnaround in ICT in Hong Kong and the recent establishment of the Hong Kong Association for Information Systems suggest a basis for boosting the status of Information Systems as a discipline in Hong Kong universities.

%X Information Systems (IS) as an academic discipline is in different stages of evolution across countries because of different environmental and situational factors. In spite of thist, most previous studies on IS have been focused mainly in western countries, while scant attention has been given to understanding its status in non-western countries especially in the Pacific Asia Region (PAR). To address this shortcoming, and as a part of the Pacific Asia multi-country case study called IS-in-PA, this study explores the status of IS as an academic discipline in Korea by analyzing the characteristics of IS programs and IS research across 10 leading Korean universities. In order to do this, in-depth interviews and intensive secondary data gathering and analysis based on the case study approach were conducted. The results of this study offer a basic understanding of the unique aspects of IS as a discipline in Korean universities, thereby enabling more effective AIS initiatives to enhance the IS discipline in Pacific Asia, in general, and Korea, in particular. This can also serve as an early groundwork for other researchers seeking to understand the current situation and emerging trends in IS as a discipline in Korea.

%X The global downturn in demand for IT skills has not left Singapore unscathed. While the demand for information systems graduates has not been as adversely affected as that for traditional computer science ones, there appears to be a drop in the entry quality of students seeking to do information systems degrees. While there appears to be some turnaround on the horizon, to better prepare for the future it is timely to examine the current state of IS as a discipline in Singapore and understand what might be the driving forces that shape it. Using Whitley's theory of scientific change as a theoretical framework [1984a, 1984b], this case study seeks to explore the degree of professionalization and the maturity of IS as a discipline in Singapore through analysis of data gathered from in-depth interviews and secondary data sources. It is found that of the four constructs proposed by Whitley for determining if a discipline is a mature, distinct scientific one, the IS discipline in Singapore clearly satisfies three: the discipline has a high level of professionalization, strong scientific reputation, and well-established research competence and skills. While the IS researchers agree that the discipline has a common vocabulary with which to communicate with one another, they also agree that it is not unknown to the researchers outside the discipline and thus, in this aspect, the discipline only satisfies part of the fourth construct in Whitley's theory.

%X Information Systems (IS) as a relatively new business discipline in Taiwan has grown rapidly in the last two decades and was once the first choice for high school students entering business schools. Even after the dot com bubble burst in 2000, it is still one of the most popular majors for college and graduate students. Most graduates have no problem finding jobs in high-tech manufacturing or service industries. This study explores the status of IS as a discipline in Taiwan by analyzing historical data collected from the IS professional association - the Chinese Association of Information Management (CSIM) and by examining characteristics of IS programs and IS research across 9 top-tier Taiwan universities. The findings indicate that the IS discipline is highly professionalized and is identified as a separate and mature field that enjoys a high level of respect in Taiwanese universities.

%X Information Systems (IS) is not a homogeneous discipline. Rather, it is comprised of various communities that are characterized by different perspectives and methods. With regard to the ongoing discussion about the profile of the discipline, this is a remarkable phenomenon. More specifically, it recommends analyzing the characteristic features of the various IS communities and explaining the diverse paths of development they took. Furthermore, it implies the question whether—and how—the current diversity could be overcome in order to foster a more focused competition as well as a more coherent presentation of research results on an international scale. This article contributes to such an investigation. It is focused on a comparison of the international English-speaking community predominantly (in particular in its early days) shaped by North-American IS researchers, which plays a leading role in the international scene, and the IS discipline in German-speaking countries (”Wirtschaftsinformatik” or WI, in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland), which constitutes the largest IS community outside North America that maintains its own approach. The focus of this article is mainly on describing the communities’ characteristics as the outcome of a social construction that is chiefly influenced by those individuals who participated in this construction. Against this background, eight scholars from North America and six scholars from German-speaking countries were interviewed at length. All were chosen as witnesses of and important contributors to the development of their discipline. As a result of this reconstruction, the article presents a rich picture of the communities’ history and characteristics as experienced and reported by the interviewees. The results obtained from this project indicate that neither of the two conceptions (IS or WI) can serve as an ideal model. Instead, a more intensive international exchange among the various research communities, including the Scandinavian and British scholars, should contribute to further develop the field into a more mature and satisfactory state.

%X On January 25, 2003, the Slammer worm (also known as Sapphire) exploded on the Internet. Within ten minutes, it had taken over 90% of all unpatched computers running SQL Server or MSDE on the Internet. This article looks at several aspects of the Slammer infestation, including how it spread, the damage it caused, the crisis in vulnerability patching that it underscored, and the implications of the fact that Slammer probably was the first of a new class of worms predicted by Staniford, Paxson, and Weaver [2002]. These worms, which we will call blitz worms, can spread faster than human intervention can prevent, and radically new approaches will be needed to stop them.

The research reported here investigates Strategic Information Systems Planning (SISP) at the county level. The first study described SISP at the state level. Because the questionnaire and research methodologies are almost identical, this study of countywide SISP closely follows the format of the SISP study conducted at the state level. The entire series of SISP studies is based on data from the Government Performance Project (GPP) survey of U.S. governments (state, county, and city) conducted by Syracuse University from 1998 through 2002.  The findings for counties mirror those for states, and indicate an absence of SISP.

%X In this paper we describe our application of a relatively untried research approach called metatriangulation. Metatriangulation is a three-phased, qualitative meta-analysis process that may be used to explore variations in the assumptions of alternative paradigms, gain insights into these multiple paradigms, and address emerging themes and the resulting theories. In applying this method we encountered difficulties in selecting a sample, in reaching agreement among coders, and in our attempts to build theory from our results. From our experiences we developed a modified version of the metatriangulation method. We did find metatriangulation to be an excellent tool in understanding theoretical perspectives in MIS research and believe the use of our modified method will aid future researchers in this pursuit.

%X Management information systems (MIS) is both a young and unique field , constantly experiencing rapid change and turmoil. Consequently, MIS research faces dual changes of rigor and relevance. Many research methodologies exist that provide various combinations of rigor and relevance. The MIS researcher selects a methodology based on several factors including rigor, relevance, subject area, and personal preferences. In this article, we examine thirteen different methodologies as used by seven leading MIS journals during a recent five-year period. The results of this extensive analysis yielded some interesting results. Survey methodology consistently ranks at the top; while frameworks and conceptual models, lab experiments, and case studies also found significant use among the MIS community. Several trends were observed, one of them being a greater use of the case study method and other qualitative technologies over the years. Clear patterns also emerged based on the journal itself and the subject areas. At a macro level, this information should help authors in the choice of appropriate methodologies to use in specific subject areas and in targeting manuscripts to appropriate journals. It would also be helpful to journal editors in assessing the type of research and methods being used across journals and subjects, and whether they need to make any changes in the emphases of their own journals.

%X The interdisciplinary nature of information systems (IS) presents significant challenges for IS teachers. This paper examines the nature of the IS teaching task. It asks: what are we trying to achieve as IS teachers? What are the characteristics of IS and what might these tell us about how we should be teaching IS? What is the nature of the multiple role of the IS teacher?  Where do our curricula come from and how do we integrate research and teaching?   Since IS has no unified theoretical foundations, unlike the computational mathematics which underpins computer science, identifying principles on which information systems teaching should be based is difficult. By identifying some of the various roles which IS teachers adopt, this paper seeks to define some overarching principles that should drive IS teaching. Teacher's roles include theoretician, practitioner, priest, counsellor and evangelist. Each of these roles suggests principles for teaching IS. The paper also suggests the key importance of networks of communication in establishing the basis of IS teaching.

%X This case study describes an Asian Information Technology (IT) outsourcing partnership in the discrete manufacturing industry. Interviews with business and IT executives of both the Outsourcing Company and the IT Services Supplier provided the necessary insights. Nowadays many organizations in discrete manufacturing move their plants to Asian countries or other lower wages countries. Most IT services suppliers in Asia are relatively inexperienced with the management of IT outsourcing relationships. However, not only are the IT services suppliers inexperienced, the outsourcing companies do not have a track record in managing IT outsourcing relationships. Cultural issues also play an important role, especially power distance and collectivism. Contrary to the level of experience, cultural factor do not change over a few years. This article aims to provide a better understanding of managing IT outsourcing partnerships in developing Asian countries on the basis of an IT outsourcing partnership model.

%X This paper examines the use of information technology in the electric and gas utilities of Ukraine, Armenia, and Georgia.  Data was gathered through the performance of Year 2000 risk assessments, small business visits, document research, and academic visits between 1999 and 2001.  Data was analyzed by comparing IT usage in Ukraine, Armenia, and Georgia to that in the United States.  Overall IT usage was found to be low, at about the level of the United States in the 1970s.  Financial difficulties and managerial issues prevent the acquisition and implementation of IT.  The electrical supply itself is insufficient to support a digital economy because of poor power quality and unreliable power sources and will require large investments to correct.

%X This paper discusses the use of interpretive research to learn about the practicality of entity-relationship modelling in ternary relationship situations.  The findings can be compared with previous studies of novice modellers who used the same invented scenario.  Previous research excluded the interaction between practitioners that would occur during a modelling session because novices were used to complete tasks in isolation.  A team of experienced practitioners are shown to use entity-relationship modelling in a business context of social interaction about design.  The interaction proves to be a key part of the modelling process.  Practitioners 'talk with the notation' as well as using the notation to draw a diagram.  The entity-relationship model constrains the social interaction because the model provides a way of talking about design.  The practitioners use the model to talk about a normalized relational data structure in a way that undermines the idea of the entity-relationship model as an independent conceptual model.  The findings show that theories from the field of linguistics explain why the model is used in this design-dependent way and suggest that this dependency may be inevitable.  When the design conversation is about a normalized relational data structure there is no benefit to the practitioners from using a special notation for ternary relationships.  On the contrary, the practitioner's design dependence seems to enable them to expose aspects of a domain that do not make business sense.  The wider implication is that interpretive research's role is important in generating insights about the extent to which conceptual modelling is usable by practitioners.  Interpretive research highlights the importance of being able to distinguish between ideas about conceptual modelling and ideas about how to apply modelling to practice.

%X A Dynamic Business Network is a distinct system of participants (customers, suppliers, complimentors, competitors, service providers) that use the network to achieve customer satisfaction and profitability and where participants and relationships evolve over time. However, unpredictability and rapid change in a Dynamic Business Network creates a significant challenge in implementing  and supporting business application software. Traditional information systems implementation methods require an a priori design and are built for a particular purpose for use over an extended period of time. Loosely coupled business networks change interrelationships between nodes both quickly and frequently, thus providing little or no notice for planning, implementing, or changing the supporting applications. The dynamic sourcing capabilities of the emerging Web Services framework provide a key to enabling these complex eco-systems. We explore the strategic and technological dimensions of Web Services and describe how they can be used to support dynamic business networks.

%X A new method of system evaluation that focuses on the impact the system has on a data series serves as the rationale for systems implementation was designed and modeled by the authors.  Called outcome-based evaluation, this method is founded on the concept of intervention analysis and employs interrupted time series designs to determine the impact of an information system on specific organizational goals.  Based on a review of the literature on the evolution of systems evaluation methods from focusing on user goals to user satisfaction and system usage, we conclude  that user satisfaction and system usage are necessary but not sufficient criteria to establish system effectiveness or success. Thus, we establish a need for the proposed new method of system evaluation.   Three business case studies are presented in this article  that demonstrate and validate an evaluation method using ARIMA models for the analysis.  The value of this tool for managers is its means of assessing IT effectiveness and payoff contextually, thereby  enabling businesses to clarify both their IT needs and their outcome expectations a priori.

%X The case describes the challenges faced by IT managers at the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in their efforts to upgrade the Bureau's IT infrastructure while developing the largest, most complex strategic application ever attempted at the Bureau. After expending 15 years of effort and $400 million, the BLM cancelled the program. The case identifies obstacles faced by IT and non-IT managers in attempting to implement strategic information technology in large, complex organizations. Obstacles identified in this case include: the BLM's culture of autonomy that tended to undermine support for the initiative, technological limitations that impacted the selection of technical standards, and organizational resource and knowledge constraints that adversely impacted the BLM's ability to manage such a large IT development effort successfully.

However, in different geographic regions several other countries are emerging as leaders in e-business infrastructure development. These Tigers of global e-business infrastructure include Singapore, India, Ireland, and Finland. This  paper describes the specific e-business infrastructure models that are taking shape in these emerging leaders. The models are differentiated in terms of their underlying IT infrastructures, human capital requirements, alliance aspects, cultural aspects, and institutional environments. The paper analyzes each model as a configuration of activities for creating competitive advantage in e-business infrastructure. Recommendations are drawn for emerging countries striving to increase their participation in global e-business.

%X Research in MIS often focuses on the relationships among latent variables of interest that cannot be directly measured. Because of potential error in measurement and associated confounding, indirect measurement of latent constructs requires formal assessments of reliability and validity. Without these measures, resultant paths in causal implications may be inaccurate, biased, and unstable. However, even with favorable metrics of validity and reliability, it is still possible for estimated models to be confounded. In many cases, such confounding occurs when a measurement item reflects more than one latent construct, that is, when there is a lack of unidimensionality. This problem can lead to false assumptions regarding the strength of paths between latent constructs and patterns of causality within a nomological network. While assessing unidimensionality is a critically important aspect of validity, it is not always formally tested in MIS research.  This tutorial introduces the concept of unidimensionality from a LISREL Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) perspective. Assuming that the underlying data distribution assumptions and model used are correct, the tutorial provides a step-by-step example of how to assess unidimensionality with LISREL. The tutorial also shows how a CFA can detect problematic multidimensional items and the problems that can occur if undetected.

%X With the inflow of an estimated $6 billion of venture capital over the past five years, E-learning is driven not only by many startup dot-com entrepreneurs but also big corporations, for-profit spin-off ventures, and big and small universities. All vie for a piece of a promising marketplace.  Many universities entered the E-learning marketplace using non-profit models, leveraging their knowledge in the traditional classroom to the E-learning environment.   Countless entrants and overwhelming numbers of services and products, coupled with market chaos, created confusion that makes it difficult to assess the E-learning industry.  This paper identifies and presents four emerging models of E-learning in terms of enterprises, target market, relative advantages and challenges.  We introduce a spatial visualization to differentiate among various E-learning models based on their educational orientations and resources. A comparison of the costs associated with E-learning from the perspectives of producers, consumers, and faculty is then presented.  We conclude by discussing the lessons that can be learned from this industry's evolution.  .

%X In 2000, a group of knowledge managers from twenty-five companies met to discuss the current state of knowledge management (KM) in their organizations. KM was then in a very early stage of its existence and took a wide variety of forms. Most KM groups were experiencing difficulties determining an appropriate role and function for themselves. Organizations were undertaking many different activities under the banner of KM. These activities were often fairly wide-ranging in scope with broad, general goals. To better understand how KM had matured and to explore its likely future development, the authors convened a similar focus group of knowledge managers in 2003. We found that KM's objectives are now focused into more achievable goals. Increasingly, the emphasis is on delivering immediate, measurable benefits by leveraging knowledge that is already available in an organization rather than on creating new knowledge. KM also carved out some key responsibilities for itself, such as creating and maintaining both an Internet framework and a portal to internal company information, and content acquisition, synthesis, organization, and management. Overall, the KM function became considerably more practical in focus and much less academic. The biggest challenge facing KM in the future continues to be the need to demonstrate tangible, measurable value to the organization. Disillusionment with KM tools and an inability to find useful content are seen as key threats to KM's survival. Maintaining alignment with business objectives is thus the most important means of ensuring KM's relevance. The next few years will be crucial for KM. If it can make its mark and demonstrate its value, we can expect to see knowledge management grow and prosper. If it cannot, its growth could be stunted for many years to come.

%X The aim of this paper is to use historical insights from modern commerce as entry points to examine the macro-level phenomena associated with electronic commerce (EC).  Commerce in its modern form first appeared in early 13th century Italy where conducive political conditions existed. Trade facilitated the exchange of goods, thereby enhancing the efficiency of processes between production and consumption. Even more important was its role in raising the level of human capital, promoting the spread of ideas and information, changing people's attitudes and behaviour. Some modern business practices and institutions which evolved with modern commerce are bookkeeping, modern banking, commodities market, putting out systems (or outsourcing as we know it now), insurance, stock exchange, and venture capital.    The current historical context favorable to EC is globalization. The emergence of network organizations helped to establish some of the practices supporting business-to-business electronic commerce. EC holds the potential to reduce time and transaction costs. However, the historical perspective suggests that the most profound implications of EC are likely to be at the macro-level or socio-institutional level. Some implications can already be seen while others are still developing. We are witnessing the impacts of EC on older business practices, and business models while there are likely implications for business cycles  Such a perspective can provide pointers for future research. Lessons from history suggest a need to pay due attention to intervention at the socio-institutional level to reap the benefits of this form of commerce.

%X This study uses the modified Gompertz model and sparse data to analyze the growth rates of different types of computer and Internet-related crimes. The Gompertz model is an appropriate diffusion model because it is capable of modeling two opposite behaviors: (1) acts of attacks and imitation of attacks and (2) deterrence acts to prevent such attacks. In addition, this model can handle sparse data adequately.  The model was used to analyze various types of attacks. The results indicated that growth patterns of computer and Internet crimes differ in growth patterns and that a relationship exists between occurrences of such security breaches and uses of certain security technologies. Thus, for example, financial fraud and denial of service are growing at a faster pace. The study also found, for example, that an increase in virus-related incidents does not necessarily increase anti-virus software use.

%X The current momentum for object oriented (OO) development in industry makes OO techniques worthy of attention. Information systems researchers and practitioners are increasingly using constructs such as use cases and class diagrams to define system requirements. A glaring weakness in the literature is the lack of useful guidelines and strategies for taking a relatively high level OO requirements model and translating it into an implementable architecture and detailed OO design. This tutorial paper demonstrates techniques for bridging the gap between OO requirements models and detailed OO design drawing on the framework provided by the Unified Process (UP) and based on concepts and techniques developed by researchers working on OO design patterns. The examples provided illustrate the transition from requirements, to architecture, to detailed design, and on to program code for one UP iteration.

%X Computer and network security are central issues confronting organizations and individuals. This paper explores the use of biology as a reference discipline that can provide meaningful insight and innovation in the area of network security. Specifically, we propose a framework for thinking about network security by examining the similarities between the defense mechanisms of a cell, and the security processes and methodologies of networked computer systems that defend an organization's information resources. Researchers and commercial developers can use this framework to help spark ideas that lead to further research and development in network security. The framework also provides a platform for educators in teaching students about the functions of computer network concepts. Our analysis of defense mechanisms in biological cells showed that security in cells is integrated, ubiquitous, and continuous. An example illustrates how the framework can generate ideas for improving network security.

%X Desktop management is the set of activities employed to manage distributed IT resources within an organization.  Reports from the late 1990s indicated that desktop management was not widely used.  This article presents the results of a survey about the extent to which desktop management functions and policies are currently implemented in practice and about the perception of the benefits of desktop management.  The primary conclusion of this technical note is that desktop management, despite moderately favorable perceptions of its benefits, is still not extensively implemented.  However, when our data are evaluated relative to earlier reports, it appears that the level of implementation increased somewhat between 1998 and 2002.

%X Conventional wisdom argues that low- and middle-income countries can use Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in general, and the Internet and the World-Wide Web in particular, to bridge the income gap with high-income countries.  The so-called "digital divide" between the rich and the poor is well documented: inhabitants of rich countries have far greater access to the Internet and other forms of ICT than inhabitants of low-income countries.  However, access to technology is only one factor affecting the ability to increase income by using the Web.  An equally important factor is the ability to attract traffic to a web site.  If the Web is to help economic development, then it is crucial that web sites publicizing investment opportunities, goods, or services attract investors and customers.  This paper sets out to determine whether there is a digital divide in web site traffic as well as in access to ICT.  The answer, it turns out, is unequivocally "yes", suggesting that the argument that the Web can be used to bridge the income gap between rich and poor countries needs considerable refinement.

%X Is the IS discipline a single discipline that focuses on both behavioral (BIS) and technical (TIS) topics, or is it two disciplines split between these orientations? Current opinion emphasizes BIS and reinforces the notion that researchers practice research in disconnected silos as opposed to a relatively continuous web. Such silos do disservice to the diversity of scholarly interests, skew productivity expectations in favor of small subsets of journals that often exclude technical- and decision science-oriented journals, and run the risk of creating self-perpetuating journal groupings. Silos disadvantage IS researchers by making the discipline narrower in comparison to other business disciplines and contradict the nature of IS pedagogy that equally reflects technology and management. We applied social network and cross-citation analyses to a sample of 98 IS journals to examine the cohesiveness of IS and to understand the extent to which boundary-spanning journals maintain scholarly connections between the approaches. Distinguishing between weak and strong ties among journals, we found that a discipline that comprises both BIS and TIS journals is highly cohesive in terms of weaker ties and that many boundary-spanning journals are quite balanced in their citations to and from each orientation. However, we did not find that IS is uniformly cohesive. Even so, our findings imply that IS scholars with different interests can parse out distinct subsets of journals that are central to their interests. We demonstrate as much by examining the most central journals for three examples of IS scholars: those with a strongly behavioral approach, with sociotechnical interests, and with specialized interests, such as medical informatics. The most central journals for these three interests are distinct subsets of the IS discipline.

%X Many organizations implement enterprise social media (ESM) in an effort to capture and store valuable knowledge that employees possess. Unfortunately, more often than not, employees do not make a large number of knowledge contributions. Using agency theory and contingency theory as foundations, we examine managerial interventions that can improve knowledge contribution rates in ESM. Specifically, we investigate the individual and joint effects of paying people to share knowledge, providing social cues, and having supporting and policing moderators on knowledge sharing. We further examine how two contingency factors—the nature of an employee’s compensation scheme (variable or fixed) for their primary work task and the employee’s belief about the importance of sharing knowledge—affect the relative efficacy of the aforementioned managerial interventions. Although we found evidence that being paid to share knowledge and believing that knowledge sharing is inherently important both increase the amount of knowledge shared, our most important results concern the existence of significant interaction effects. For persons who receive a fixed salary, we found a surprisingly large, positive synergistic effect between being paid to share knowledge and believing that knowledge sharing is important. However, introducing a policing moderator almost completely nullified this synergistic effect. We discuss the implications of these findings for both practice and research.

%X Literature reviews (LRs) are recognized for their increasing impact in the information systems literature. Methodologists have drawn attention to the question of how we can leverage the value of LRs to preserve and generate knowledge. The panelists who participated in the discussion of “Standalone Literature Reviews in IS Research: What Can Be Learnt from the Past and Other Fields?” at ICIS 2016 in Dublin acknowledged this significant issue and debated 1) what the IS field can learn from other fields and where IS-specific challenges occur, 2) how the IS field should move forward to foster the genre of LRs, and 3) the best practices to train doctoral IS students in publishing LRs. This paper reports the key takeaways of this panel discussion. We provide guidance for IS scholars on how to conduct LRs that contribute to the cumulative knowledge development in and across the IS field to best prepare the next generation of IS scholars.

%X Social media plays an instrumental role in enabling and facilitating social movements. However, this role depends on the complex social issues in a civic community and dynamics of power in movement politics. Existing literature provides little insight into the formative role of social media in social movements; instead, it tends to focus on the informational role and episodic effect of social media in community activism. We present the case of Bersih, a social media-enabled social movement that pushed for electoral reform in Malaysia. The non-partisan community-driven movement exerted public pressure on institutions and gained formal recognition. In this study, we reveal the significant role social media plays in empowering citizens by enabling them to facilitate and coordinate collective action towards producing change in their community. This research is significant in articulating the precise nature of the role of ICT in addressing complex social problems.

%X In this study, we examine the historical information systems research collaboration network. We build the network using coauthorship information in the Senior Scholars’ basket of eight journals from the publication of MISQ’s first issue in April, 1977, to November, 2015. The different journals vary widely in their network configurations. We examine the influence of gender homophily, geographic homophily, and field tenure heterophily on coauthorship in the network. From using exponential random graph modeling (ERGM) on a randomly selected subset of the network, we present preliminary evidence that suggests that ties in the IS collaboration network exhibit homophily according to gender and geography. Conversely, coauthorship seems to exhibit heterophily along the temporal dimension: short-tenured researchers in the field prefer to collaborate with long-tenured researchers. ERGM enables one to make statistical inferences concerning the influence of node attributes and structural variables on network formation, which is hard to do with logistical regression because network relationships violate the independence of observations assumption. We also reveal the current center of the IS collaboration network. Based on this center, we propose a metric to measure a researcher’s connectedness in the network.

%X Amid social and political upheavals and economic uncertainties and the increasingly pivotal role of information and communications technologies in society, the information systems (IS) field is perfectly positioned to address the social and technical implications stemming from these developments. One can find such discussions in historical and philosophical papers that have always attracted IS researchers’ attention but that have not received a formal channel to grow and thrive. The history and philosophy department of the Communications of the Association for Information Systems provides such a channel. By providing an avenue to analyze historic events and past successes and failures and to encourage new philosophical thinking for the present and the future, the history and philosophy department seeks to achieve what Peter Keen (1991, p. 27) once prognosticated: for the IS field to be at the “forefront of intellectual debate and investigation about the application of IT across every aspect of…society”. With this lofty goal in mind and to encourage a shift towards writing more historical and philosophical research, I describe these two intricately related genres of research that are distinct from the hypothetico-deductive research that crowds the pages of our journals but that perhaps hold the most potential for moving the IS field towards becoming an intellectually and socially influential discipline.

%X We conceived The World IT Project, the largest study of its kind in the IS field, more than a decade ago. This ambitious mega project with an enormous global scale was formally launched in 2013 and is expected to finish by 2017. Major publications on the project should appear through 2019. The project responded to the pervasive bias in IS research towards American and Western views. What IS research glaringly lacks is a global view that tries to understand the major IS issues in the world in the context of unique cultural, economic, political, religious, and societal environments. The World IT Project captures the organizational, technological, and individual issues of IT employees across the world and relates them to cultural and organizational factors. This first major paper provides the project’s objectives and history, its general framework, governance, important decision points, and recommendations for future researchers based on lessons learned. Ultimately, we hope to provide a world view of IT issues that will be relevant to stakeholders at the firm, national, and international levels. We also invite scholars to send their recommendations for analyzing and writing papers using our vast database.
